  "content_html": "<p>Brenda Bailey, B.C.\u2019s finance minister, said her recent tour of industrial and port sites in the Northwest is part of a broader effort to see firsthand the projects driving the province\u2019s economic future.</p>\n<p>During a visit the week of Oct. 15 that included stops at LNG Canada, Cedar LNG and the Port of Prince Rupert, Bailey said being on the ground helps her in her roles as both finance minister and chair of the provincial Treasury Board, which reviews and approves major capital projects.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt really enhances my understanding when I get to have feet on the ground \u2014 and those feet in boots,\u201d Bailey said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to read about it. It\u2019s totally another thing to see it.\u201d</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Bailey said touring facilities is critical to her decision-making because reading about the projects from Victoria only goes so far. She described her tour of LNG Canada as crucial to understanding the scale and complexity of the facility.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to really understand what it means until you see it,\u201d she said. \u201c50,000 people contributed to that project. There\u2019s now about 1,000 on the ground, and if LNG Canada Phase 2 goes ahead, you\u2019ll see that giant workforce again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Premier David Eby toured the LNG Canada site in Kitimat in July and touted the second phase of the project, which would see the pipeline and export facility approximately double their capacity.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m very much looking forward to coming back here and making the announcement of an LNG Canada Phase 2,\u201d Eby said at the time.</p>\n<p>Bailey said her trip followed the premier\u2019s own because many of the same projects are now at critical stages of development.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur premier says British Columbia is going to become the economic driver of Canada, and that really is his vision,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cAt this time, when we have a trade war and our most reliable trade partner has turned on us, it\u2019s a real opportunity for us to step into that moment as British Columbians.\u201d</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Bailey said the combination of high tariffs on lumber exports and growing Asian demand for energy and minerals means the province must strengthen other markets and supply chains.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have to make sure that we\u2019re becoming self-sufficient in our economy and not as reliant on the U.S.,\u201d she said. \u201cThis part of the world is a huge part of that solution.\u201d</p>\n<p>Asked about environmental concerns tied to resource development, Bailey said the province aims to lead globally in reducing emissions intensity while maintaining high environmental standards.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur LNG is much lower-carbon than comparative LNGs around the world,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen Cedar comes online, it\u2019s actually going to be the lowest-carbon LNG because it\u2019s produced with electricity.\u201d</p>\n<p>She added that B.C. has 17 of the critical minerals needed for electrification and that recent clean-energy project approvals included significant Indigenous ownership.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoing this work in conjunction with building the economy, ensuring partnership with nations, and doing it in the least environmentally harmful way possible is the way forward,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>At the Port of Prince Rupert, Bailey said she was struck by how quickly expansion projects have advanced since her last visit in 2023.</p>\n<p>\u201cEvery time I\u2019ve been to the port, it\u2019s more developed,\u201d she said. \u201cWe shave off 10 days of transportation compared to the Port of Los Angeles, and each day represents about $100,000 for a container ship. The opportunity in front of us is significant.\u201d</p>\n<p>She toured the under-construction Ridley Island Energy Export Facility (REEF) and other expansion areas at the port.</p>\n<p>\u201cEighteen months ago, they were just speaking about it,\u201d she said. \u201cNow it\u2019s nearing completion. The opportunities are huge.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bailey said continuing to visit northern communities will remain a priority as major projects reshape the province\u2019s economic and environmental landscape.</p>\n<p><em>\u2014With files from Quinn Bender</em></p>",
