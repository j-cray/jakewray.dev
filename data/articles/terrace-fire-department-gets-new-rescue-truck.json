  "content_html": "<p>The Terrace Fire Department has a shiny new rescue truck.</p>\n<p>The $760,000 vehicle was purchased using a $500,000 donation from LNG Canada, with the City covering the rest of the bill.</p>\n<p>Unlike a fire engine, the new rescue truck will not carry water, said Deputy Fire Chief Dave Jephson.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cWe\u2019re calling this a rescue truck, highway rescue because it responds the bulk of the time to motor vehicle accidents outside of Terrace, but it also responds to motor vehicle accidents in Terrace,\u201d he said, adding that the truck could also be used in other scenarios such as basic water rescues or hazmat situations. \u201cObviously we have great staff, their roles and responsibility are huge. This gives them another option to respond with different types of tools, different things that are needed either on the fire ground, or rescue.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The truck could also be used at fires as a support vehicle.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe use it for rehab, so at a larger fire we start taking the blood pressure of all our members to make sure that they\u2019re safe and working within certain criteria. Winter time, we need shelter to go and thaw their packs and thaw their gear out,\u201d Jephson said.</p>\n<p>The brand of the truck is E-ONE, a company the Terrace Fire Department has done business with in the past with great results, Jephson said. He noted one advantage of buying this truck is that it is built completely by E-ONE instead of being assembled by multiple companies, which means the warranty will be reliable.</p>\n<p>\u201c[E-ONE] can look after that [warranty]. They can\u2019t blame it on another customer or somebody else adding to it,\u201d he said.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Mayor Carol Leclerc said that when LNG Canada offered to make a large donation, it was councillor Brian Downie who had the idea to put the money toward a new rescue truck. Leclerc thanked LNG Canada for the contribution.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen LNG Canada came up, stepped up to the plate, this just made things that much easier for us. $500,000 in the City budget is huge. Like that\u2019s half of a road construction job,\u201d she said. \u201cA huge thank-you to LNG Canada for recognizing the impact that this project will have in the Northwest \u2026 It\u2019s nice to have industry partners that come and help with municipal projects.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jennifer Prochera, a senior community engagement advisor with LNG Canada, said the company recognizes its project will bring a lot of traffic to the highway between Terrace and Kitimat, so a highway rescue vehicle is a \u201cwin-win\u201d for the company and the communities.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn construction phase, we\u2019re going to have up to 7,000 in and out of the Terrace airport and into Kitimat, so the highway is going to be busy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe like to think that we\u2019re going to leave the communities better than they were when we got here.\u201d</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",
