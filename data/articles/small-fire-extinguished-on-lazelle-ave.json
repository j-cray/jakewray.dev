There was also smoke damage inside the building.</p>\n<p>The fire was extinguished by the time <em>The Terrace Standard </em>spoke with Jephson around 11 a.m.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fire is out at this point and crews are just trying to clean up and mitigate any damage for the owner,\u201d he said.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Jephson said this fire is a good reminder for folks to be aware of their surroundings, since quick notification from the public helped prevent significant damage to the building.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook after your neighbour. Be aware of what\u2019s going on around you,\u201d he said.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",
