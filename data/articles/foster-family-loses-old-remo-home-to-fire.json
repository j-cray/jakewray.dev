  "content_html": "<p>Natasha Candelora left her house in Old Remo around 5:10 p.m. on Oct. 7 to take her two children into town for Taekwondo practice. Within an hour, their home burned to the ground, leaving behind only a smoldering pile of rubble.</p>\n<p>The fire was devastating for the family. Not only did it completely destroy their home and all their possessions (including irreplaceable photographs), it also jeopardized Natasha\u2019s eligibility to continue as a foster parent to the two children, whom she has cared for the last seven years and loves as her own.</p>\n<p>She said that day leading up to the fire was a bit hectic but relatively normal. She spent the day on a cleaning frenzy and prepped dinner before rounding the kids up for the trip into town.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>It was Natasha\u2019s parents, Bob and Barb Wilson, and brother Tony Candelora who saw smoke rising from Natasha\u2019s house. They live right next door in another house on the same property \u2014 a small farm where the family keeps a few horses and domestic pets.</p>\n<p>Bob and Tony rushed outside when they saw the smoke. Tony didn\u2019t even put on shoes. Bob said they went inside the burning house to get the pets out.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe whole roof of the house, inside the house, was just swirling with smoke,\u201d Bob said. \u201cThere was no flames or nothing, it was just smoke. Black smoke, just like curls on a woman\u2019s hair \u2026 It was weird. It really was.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony got the dog, Redford, a rust-coloured doberman, out safely. The cats took care of themselves. Bob and Tony got the rabbits out.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen we turned around and looked back and the whole roof just come down,\u201d Bob said, noting that when he and Tony opened the door to enter, air flowed up to the fire smoldering in the roof of the home. \u201cProbably within less than 45 seconds the whole thing just come crashing down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Barb dialed 9-1-1, momentarily forgetting that their property is outside the Thornhill Volunteer Fire Department\u2019s coverage zone. The operator reiterated that fact and dispatched RCMP to assist.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Rick Boehm, chief of the Thornhill fire department, told <em>The Terrace Standard </em>that it\u2019s always tough for the fire department when they hear about a fire just outside their protection zone. The zone boundary is a federally-mandated 8-kilometre radius around the fire hall. Firefighters are only allowed to leave their protection boundary when someone\u2019s life is in danger, such as a person trapped in a burning building, which wasn\u2019t the case with this fire.</p>\n<p>Barb said it wouldn\u2019t have mattered anyway. From start to finish, the fire only lasted about 20 minutes, and she figures the fire department wouldn\u2019t have been able to react in time.</p>\n<p>Boehm said that it does indeed take some time to get fire engines out to Old Remo.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Old Remo location is sort of compound affected by the significant climb up that hill,\u201d he said. \u201c[Fire engines] can only go so quick on that little road and it is quite a slug to get those heavy, heavy trucks up that hill.\u201d</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the kids were at Taekwando and Natasha was relaxing at Cafenara with her boyfriend, Terry Healy, who had just arrived in Terrace that evening after a day of work in Prince Rupert. That\u2019s when Natasha\u2019s cell phone rang.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mom\u2019s yelling at me \u2018Your house is on fire\u2019 and I\u2019m like \u2018what?\u2019\u201d Natasha said. \u201cYou\u2019re in shock when you hear that.\u201d</p>\n<p>She rushed to gather the children from Taekwando while Terry jumped in his truck and drove like mad out to Old Remo. Even at breakneck speed, the roughly 14-kilometre drive from Terrace to the farm still leaves enough time for one\u2019s mind to churn.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was wondering how far along the fire was. Can we save anything?\u201d Terry said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that the house was totally gone. I didn\u2019t assume it would be that bad [but] as soon as I started down Queensway, and you look back this way, all you could see is a cloud of black smoke.\u201d</p>\n<p>Natasha was just minutes behind with the children.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt looked like the whole forest was on fire,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>When she arrived, she noticed a collection of onlookers.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe had a lineup of people sitting in their cars, and I have to say, for me one of the most awful feelings is people sitting in their vehicle with their windows rolled up watching your house burn down,\u201d Natasha said, tears welling in her eyes as she recalled the memory.</p>\n<p>But there were also friendly neighbours who arrived to help. A pair of them comforted Natasha.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re holding me and I\u2019m getting sick beside the car,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming, the grief, the panic that goes through your mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014 ~ \u2014</p>\n<p>Nearly four weeks after the fire, the smell of smoke still hangs in the air at the family farm. It\u2019s Oct. 30 and the rubble has yet to be cleared. Redford, the doberman, has bandages on his front paws because he cut them mucking about in the debris.</p>\n<p>The debris won\u2019t be cleared until Natasha\u2019s insurance processes the claim, and snow might fall before that, meaning cleanup may not happen until next year. Candelora says dealing with the insurance company has been straightforward (the company already supplied emergency funding for a hotel stay and items such as clothes) but the process inherently takes time. She is also waiting for the insurance company to complete an investigation of the fire and determine the cause \u2014 something the fire department would do, if Natasha\u2019s home were within the fire protection district.</p>\n<p>The family sits in the living room of Bob and Barb\u2019s home. Natasha is still under a lot of stress trying to sort out new living arrangements and replace essential items, and the whole family is worn out from the ordeal. But they haven\u2019t lost their senses of humour. They all laugh as Barb describes how Natasha\u2019s cats moved themselves, with an air of entitlement, into Bob and Barb\u2019s home.</p>\n<p>The children, who are both around 12 years old, are coping fairly well, all things considered. The brother and sister are not identified in this story because provincial policy prevents foster children from being identified in the media. Initially, the girl was scared to go back to school because she was afraid of what all the other kids would say, but when she did go back she found her peers to be caring and supportive. The boy has expressed some anger following the fire.</p>\n<p>Bob and Natasha also say they are frustrated, particularly with B.C.\u2019s Ministry of Children and Family Development, which oversees the foster care program. Bob and Barb are also foster parents, currently caring for four children. Bob and Barb have been foster parents for 25 years and Natasha has been a foster parent for 19 years. They say the ministry has been insulting and unhelpful in the aftermath of the fire, despite the decades-long relationship between the family and the ministry.</p>\n<p>Almost immediately after the fire, a ministry worker informed Natasha that she had 30 days to find a new place or the children could be taken from her because Natasha\u2019s contract with the ministry states she must have her own dwelling with enough bedrooms for each of the children to have their own.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s tough some days, but it is equally rewarding or you wouldn\u2019t do it. It\u2019s not for everyone to be a foster parent, but it\u2019s something we\u2019ve chosen as a family to give back. We feel it\u2019s our calling,\u201d Natasha says. \u201cAnd then I don\u2019t have the home any more so now I\u2019m told \u2026 \u2018you have a month to find a suitable place to raise these children.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Candelora says the ministry\u2019s lack of flexibility on the timeline is unreasonable because rental properties are scarce in the Terrace area and the ministry offered no help in locating a rental or financial assistance with rent despite the fact that rent prices are much higher than her monthly mortgage payment. She says the ministry should have contingency funding to support foster families in crises.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou would think that there would be maybe something set aside by the government for emergency,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that there isn\u2019t some funding.\u201d</p>\n<p>She says the notion that her children could be taken from her adds unnecessary pressure to an already stressful situation.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo these kids that know no one but me as their mother would have to go live with someone [else],\u201d Natasha says through tears. \u201cIf they\u2019re not with me they\u2019ve been with my parents. They don\u2019t know anyone but us. And they\u2019re going to have to suffer and be punished for something out of all of our control? Because it\u2019s not [ministry] policy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we try to resolve situations in the ministry, we always get \u2018well, it\u2019s our policy,\u2019\u201d Bob says. \u201cEven though the policy doesn\u2019t make any common sense, even if you couldn\u2019t live by that policy, we are expected to live by that policy.\u201d</p>\n<p>The ministry offered only limited financial support to replace the children\u2019s belongings like jackets and boots, Bob says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was very insulting for [ministry workers] to come out here two days after the fire with a dozen donuts and four cups of coffee and $200 for one child and $200 for another child to replace everything that [the children] owned,\u201d Bob says.</p>\n<p>The family says they could face consequences for speaking out against the ministry, which has a culture of silence, but they are fed up with the mistreatment.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause of what I have said \u2026 I could [metaphorically] have a knife to my throat tomorrow,\u201d Bob says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s their own little secret society,\u201d Natasha says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s sad. And that\u2019s why in our community we have very few foster parents. And very few relief workers,\u201d Bob says.</p>\n<p>A manager of the local ministry office refused a request for comment and would not provide a reason why.</p>\n<p>Angus Noble, a public affairs officer who works for the ministry at the provincial level, said foster parents are required to have their own home insurance that covers emergencies like fires or floods.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn addition, [the ministry] supports the availability of \u2018Extended Property Damage (Rider) Insurance\u2019 to supplement a residential caregiver\u2019s homeowner or tenant insurance policy,\u201d Noble said in an email statement. \u201cThis mirrors a foster parent\u2019s basic coverage where damage is caused by a child or youth in care.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noble said that when a foster parent suddenly loses access to housing, the ministry will work the parent to find a suitable alternative. He said that if the foster parent\u2019s insurance didn\u2019t cover the cost of alternative housing, the ministry may be able to pay for temporary support such as a hotel stay.</p>\n<p>\u2014 ~ \u2014</p>\n<p>On Nov. 5, Natasha said she had finally secured a rental for her and the children. That was a great relief, she said, though many challenges for the family still lie ahead, such as ironing out insurance details, managing the tricky financial situation, and creating a sense of normalcy for the children.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s deeply grateful to the Terrace area community who helped her family by donating money and clothing, particularly for the children.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got a decent pair of winter boots on their feet,\u201d she said. \u201cWithout the community\u2019s help, honestly I would have been screwed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Natasha said relying on the community and her family for help can be uncomfortable at times, because she was so proud to have lived as an independent woman raising her children before the fire. Nevertheless, she appreciates the help.</p>\n<p>Anyone interested in providing support to the family can contact Natasha directly at natashacandelora@gmail, or through Facebook.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img alt=\"23192331_web1_fire-debris-1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/jakewray-portfolio/media/journalism/foster-family-loses-old-remo-home-to-fire/23192331_web1_fire-debris-1.jpg\"/><figcaption>Natasha Candelora and her family are waiting for their insurance company to process their claim before debris from their home that burned down.
