The resulting lava flow is believed to have killed approximately 2,000 Nisga\u2019a people, destroying three villages in the Nass Valley. This scientific understanding is corroborated by Nisga\u2019a oral history. Now the vast fields of lava rock are preserved as a provincial park, jointly managed by the Nisga\u2019a Lisims government and the B.C. government.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The volcano has been researched before, but until now there had never been extensive mapping of the volcano cone or the beds of lava rock that were formed when lava flowed 32 km into the valley, nor had a precise timeline of events been established.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In summer 2016, researchers from SFU, UBC, and Quest University in Squamish began fieldwork in the lava beds, returning again in the summers of 2017 and 2019. They studied the surface of the lava beds, measured the depth of the lava beds at various points, and measured the depth of Lava Lake and Melita Lake, to determine how much lava had flowed into those waters. The researchers also obtained aerial photos of the volcano cone and lava beds. The data was then punched into 3D modelling software for further insight.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The research culminated in a paper called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17445647.2020.1758809\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Physical</a><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17445647.2020.1758809\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> volcanology of Tseax </a><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17445647.2020.1758809\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Volcano,</a>\u201d which was published online May 12. Lead author of the paper Yannick Le Moigne is a PhD candidate at SFU and the paper is his PhD thesis.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Le Moigne told <em>The Terrace Standard </em>that the biggest surprise from the research was just how much lava flowed from the relatively small volcano.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThe volcano is very, very small compared to the lava flow,\u201d he said, comparing the size of the lava flow to the size of the Skeena River today. \u201c[It was] an enormous volume of lava flow, very hot \u2026 flowing like a river in the valleys, reaching the [Nisga\u2019a] villages in a day or two, destroying everything in its path.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many of the Nisga\u2019a people were killed by a poisonous gas, not the lava itself, according to Nisga\u2019a oral history that was recorded in the Canadian Geographical Journal in 1935. Le Moigne said that is likely true, but he and other researchers can only speculate about gasses related to the eruption.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThey were not necessarily killed by the lava flow, but maybe once the lava flow arrived, was in contact with the Nass River, there would have been some gas emissions,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have \u2026 a very hot lava flow, in contact with the cold water like the Nass River, you have a lot of emissions of vapor of water, but also any volcanic gasses like CO2, sulphuric gasses, etc., and if you smell those gasses you could be in trouble.\u201d</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-487\" data-attachment-id=\"487\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"200611-tst-tseax-volcano-2\" data-large-file=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/jakewray-portfolio/media/journalism/scientists-produce-extensive-map-of-tseax-volcano-lava-flow/200611-tst-tseax-volcano-2.jpeg?w=660\" data-medium-file=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/jakewray-portfolio/media/journalism/scientists-produce-extensive-map-of-tseax-volcano-lava-flow/200611-tst-tseax-volcano-2.jpeg?w=246\" data-orig-file=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/jakewray-portfolio/media/journalism/scientists-produce-extensive-map-of-tseax-volcano-lava-flow/200611-tst-tseax-volcano-2.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"1500,1831\" data-permalink=\"https://jakewrayportfolio.wordpress.com/200611-tst-tseax-volcano-2/\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/jakewray-portfolio/media/journalism/scientists-produce-extensive-map-of-tseax-volcano-lava-flow/scientists-produce-extensive-map-of-tseax-volcano-lava-flow-2.jpeg\" width=\"839\"/></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Tseax Volcano is unlikely to erupt again, Le Moigne said. It was formed as the result of rifting, where two tectonic places pull apart, thinning the Earth\u2019s crust and allowing magma to spill out from the Earth\u2019s mantle. This process typically results in volcanos that only erupt once, which is true for most volcanos in northern B.C. and Alaska.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cAll these volcanos, like 90 per cent of them, are monogenetic volcanos, because they only erupted one time, and then [they stop],\u201d Le Moigne said. \u201cSo, at the moment, we are thinking that Tseax is also a monogenetic volcano \u2026 But we are not 100 per cent sure, maybe in the future there will be another eruption.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Le Moigne, who is from France, said he chose to come work on the Tseax Volcano for his PhD because the volcano had barely been studied.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt was an opportunity to study everything, from the basic, to the more complex history of the volcano,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nisga\u2019a people provided great assistance to the research, Le Moigne said, a contribution not available in most earth science studies.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThey gave us a lot of data from their oral histories, and that helped us a lot when we wrote, step by step, what happened at Tseax,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very cool project to merge the two aspects of the world. You have the [earth] science, and then you have the \u2026 social science from the Nisga\u2019a.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.terracestandard.com/news/scientists-produce-extensive-map-of-tseax-volcano-lava-flow/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Terrace Standard.</a></p>\n </div>",
