  "content_html": "<p>Top Speed Energy\u2019s proposed Skeena LNG project has received a vote of confidence from BC Liberal Skeena MLA Ellis Ross.</p>\n<p>Skeena LNG would be a relatively small LNG operation sited at the Skeena Industrial Development Park just south of the Northwest Regional Airport. It would take gas from the existing Pacific Northern Gas pipeline which runs through the location, then use hydro electricity to supercool the gas down to -100 degrees Celsius or cooler, rendering the gas inert. The gas could then be stored in special containers, trucked to the port in Prince Rupert and exported to Asian markets.</p>\n<p>Ross met with Terrace city council May 27 specifically to advocate for the project, touting it as a way to recover the region\u2019s economy once pandemic precautions are lifted. He said one of the main advantages of Skeena LNG is that it\u2019s small enough to avoid provincial red tape while seeking approval, so it can be up and running quickly.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Natural gas project proposals below a certain size do not need to pass a review by B.C.\u2019s Environmental Assessment Office, according to the B.C. Environmental Assessment Act. Small projects instead go directly to the B.C. Oil and Gas Commission for review. However, B.C.\u2019s environment minister has the power to order an environmental assessment of any proposal if a member of the public writes to request one and the minister deems a review to be in the public interest.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s imperative the Skeena LNG project avoid the Environmental Assessment Office, Ross told council.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have no idea where that\u2019s going to go if it ends up at that place. You have no idea how long it\u2019s going to take, how long it\u2019s going to cost,\u201d he said. \u201cThe permitting has to stay within the B.C. Oil and Gas Commission, and keep it at that. That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about in terms of red tape.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anne Hill, co-chair of environmental advocacy group North West Watch, said her organization will be writing the environment minister to request an environmental assessment of the Skeena LNG project. She said North West Watch has raised several safety concerns about the project and the only answers they\u2019ve received have come from Top Speed Energy.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just rely on the proponent to answer questions about the safety of their own project,\u201d she said, adding that North West Watch does not have faith in the B.C. Oil and Gas Commission\u2019s review process. \u201cThe B.C. Oil and Gas Commission are not in the business of rejecting projects. It is basically a rubber stamp.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ross also told council at the May 27 meeting that he is concerned about regulatory delays due to the pandemic.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cThe only question right now is the timing, and the efficiency in terms of the responses that Top Speed is going to get from the regulator, which is the Oil and Gas Commission. This COVID-19 has slowed down everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to know, number one, when do we get back on track? Any kind of news is good news in terms of what the Oil and Gas Commission will do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clark Roberts, CEO of Top Speed Energy, told the <em>The Terrace Standard</em> that the application process to the oil and gas commission is still moving along.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure COVID-19 has slowed things down a bit, but [the B.C. Oil and Gas Commission] haven\u2019t stopped the project, and we\u2019re hopeful that we will obtain our facility permit in due course,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Council opted to invite a representative of the B.C. Oil and Gas Commission to appear before council to provide more information.</p>\n<p>Council had previously passed a motion Dec. 9, 2019 declaring support for the Skeena LNG project, provided the proposal passes review by the B.C. Oil and Gas Commission. Councillor Jessica McCallum-Miller opposed the motion, according to minutes from the meeting. The motion was put forward by councillor James Cordeiro following a presentation Hill made to council about North West Watch\u2019s concerns regarding Skeena LNG.</p>\n<p>Hill told <em>The Terrace Standard</em> that she was displeased with council\u2019s response to her presentation.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey appear to be pushing the project and they are very resistant to asking too many questions. That was my feeling,\u201d she said.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",
