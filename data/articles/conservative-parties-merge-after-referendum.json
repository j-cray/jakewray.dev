The referendum required over 50 per cent of PC Alberta votes and 75 per cent of Wildrose Party votes in order to pass. 95 per cent of the ballots from each party were cast in favour of unity.</p>\n<p>The new conglomerate party, called the United Conservative Party (UCP), is now the official opposition in Alberta\u2019s legislature. The UCP selected Nathan Cooper, who came into the UCP as a Wildrose Party MLA, to serve as its interim leader until the actual leadership vote on Oct. 28.</p>\n<p>Jim Lightbody, a political scientist at the University of Alberta, said there is still plenty of work to be done in merging the two parties.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of mechanical stuff. Integrating constitutions, figuring out how to deal with financial rules,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got two quite autonomous organizations here. Even though they\u2019ve voted to unite, each thinks they\u2019re better than the other. There\u2019s going to be a lot of personalities that have to be dealt with, so it\u2019s a long path to get to the unified party.\u201d</p>\n<p>The core principles of the UCP won\u2019t be finalized until a leader is elected in October, according to Lightbody. He said PC Alberta leader Jason Kenney and Wildrose Party leader Brian Jean are likely to be the frontrunners in that leadership race.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause of their experience being leaders and because of the fact that they will have had close working relations with many of the people who will form the party executive and the two caucuses in the legislature, whether that will present an insurmountable barrier, I think it will, to someone from outside coming in, remains to be seen,\u201d Lightbody said. \u201cThere\u2019s no one in the legislature who has sufficient standing to be taken seriously (as a leadership candidate) in comparison to Kenney and Jean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gord Molnar, a Wildrose Party member (and now UCP member) from Stony Plain, said he will keep an open mind throughout the leadership race.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will be open moving forward, with how each of the candidates present themselves, because I don\u2019t know all the candidates very well, but I do know Brian Jean. If I had to vote today, I\u2019d vote for Brian Jean,\u201d Molnar said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really (strike) me as being one of the old boys\u2019 club. He seems to be a little bit of, I guess, a revolutionary. He\u2019s got some very strong credentials. He\u2019s a lawyer by trade, but he\u2019s also a trapper, so when you look at blue-collar/white-collar, he fits the mould of probably (the majority) of the populace.\u201d</p>\n<p>Molnar said he voted in favour of unification. His biggest concern moving forward, he said, is that core Wildrose Party values could get put aside in the merger.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only fear that I have is maybe losing some of those grassroots principles, where everyone has a voice. Like, even the MLAs I think within the Wildrose, they\u2019re allowed a free vote. They\u2019re allowed to vote on conscience. They don\u2019t necessarily have to toe the party line,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are things that are really held strong in my view, is the fact that you can be free in the Wildrose. You can speak what you want to speak and you can do what you want to do without recourse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Article originally appeared in <a href=\"http://www.sprucegroveexaminer.com/2017/07/27/conservative-parties-merge-after-referendum\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Spruce Grove Examiner</a></p>\n </div>",
