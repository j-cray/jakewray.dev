  "content_html": "<p>A Terrace-based nurse and union representative delivered a stark message to city council at a meeting on Oct. 27, describing a \u201csevere\u201d nursing shortage where \u201cfor every 10 that we\u2019re recruiting, nine are still leaving.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marley Emery, a frontline nurse and lobby coordinator for the BC Nurses Union (BCNU), urged council to become allies in retaining and recruiting nurses. The union\u2019s primary solution is the implementation of minimum nurse-to-patient ratios, a policy Emery said is backed by 84% of the union\u2019s 50,000 members.</p>\n<p>Emery pointed to a successful pilot program in Smithers, which she said filled 95% of its nursing vacancies within six months.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cThey had 20 people come back from working in the community,\u201d she said, adding that successes in California and Australia also showed that ratios bring nurses back to the profession.</p>\n<p>While nurse-to-patient ratios are a provincial matter, Emery asked the city to make the community more attractive to healthcare professionals. She identified housing, childcare (specifically 24/7 care), transportation, and recreational opportunities as the top four factors for nurses.</p>\n<p>Mayor Sean Bujtas, attending the meeting remotely, noted that while housing and childcare are provincial responsibilities, the city is trying to support solutions. He suggested the city should inquire with Northern Health and the provincial government about the Smithers pilot program.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it\u2019s working well in Smithers, then maybe we should be pushing government to expand that into the Terrace area,\u201d Bujtas said.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div>",
