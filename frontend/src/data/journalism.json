    "content_html": "<p>Six million dollars are once again on the line for Terrace and Kitselas First Nation.</p>\n<p>Taisheng International Investment Services, the former developer of the Skeena Industrial Development Park (SIDP), is appealing a court decision from October 2025 that saw a joint venture between the City of Terrace and Kitselas First Nation keep a $6 million construction deposit from Taisheng after the developer did not build a groundwater system at the SIDP.</p>\n<p>Court documents obtained by <em>The Terrace Standard</em> show that an appeal was filed in November 2025 but do not list an argument for the appeal. Representatives of Taisheng Internatioal Investment Services did not respond to request for comment by press deadline.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>A spokesperson for the City of Terrace confirmed the City is still in litigation for the $6 million, and said that the City is currently lobbying higher levels of government for money to get the groundwater system built at the SIDP.</p>\n<p>\u201cBased on Taisheng incomplete drawings it is believed very rough (no quotes involved yet) $32 million dollar cost to get water in the park,\u201d the spokesperson said in an email. \u201cHence, we are in the process of lobbying the government for a package of money that won\u2019t set Terrace back even further.\u201d</p>\n<p>The decision in October dismissed a lawsuit from Taisheng International Investment Services seeking to recover the $6 million deposit. The judge, Justice Underhill, stated that Taisheng was not entitled to the return of the deposit after it failed to meet contractual deadlines, which ultimately led the City of Terrace to repurchase the lands.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo find otherwise,\u201d the justice wrote, \u201cwould result in Taisheng receiving a $6.18 million windfall.\u201d</p>\n<p>The case originates from a 2014 agreement where Taisheng agreed to purchase 1,187 acres of land from the city for $11.878 million. The contract required Taisheng to develop the lands into an industrial park, which included constructing a road and a groundwater system.</p>\n<p>Under the agreement, Taisheng was eligible for reimbursements for this infrastructure work if it met specific deadlines. The city agreed to reimburse Taisheng approximately $6.18 million for the construction of the groundwater system.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>By 2019, with the system still not built, the parties executed an amendment to their contract. In a transaction that occurred on June 28, 2019, the City of Terrace paid Taisheng the $6,183,686.80 \u201cgroundwater reimbursement.\u201d On the same day, Taisheng paid the exact same amount back to the city, where it was held as a \u201cconstruction deposit\u201d to be used as security for the completion of the water system.</p>\n<p>According to the court decision, Taisheng failed to meet the construction milestones set out in the development plan. As a result, the City of Terrace exercised its option to purchase the land back on Oct. 15, 2021, a move that was validated in a separate arbitration proceeding. The lands were officially transferred back to the city on Oct. 4, 2023.</p>\n<p>A day later, Taisheng demanded the return of its $6.18 million deposit, arguing that since the city now owned the land, it could not use the deposit for its intended purpose. In a joint statement, the City of Terrace and Kitselas First Nation confirmed the \u201cconstruction deposit will be retained by the Joint Venture to be used on the park\u2019s groundwater system,\u201d which is now estimated to cost over $14 million.</p>\n<p>Taisheng argued that the contract\u2019s terms meant the deposit could only be used for work \u201cattributable to the purchaser\u201d (Taisheng) and that the city exercising its buy-back option made this impossible. Justice Underhill rejected this interpretation, calling it \u201ccommercially absurd.\u201d He found the contract\u2019s language was \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d that the money was security.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe intention of the parties, reflected in the language of the purchase agreement, is clear,\u201d the decision said. \u201cThe purpose of the transaction was to see the SIDP developed, and it was expressly structured to secure Taisheng\u2019s commitments to proceed with that development in a timely manner, failing which Terrace could repurchase the lands.\u201d</p>\n<p>The judge also dismissed Taisheng\u2019s alternative argument that keeping the deposit amounted to an \u201cunenforceable penalty.\u201d He ruled the deposit was not \u201cunconscionable\u201d or \u201cpenal,\u201d especially given the high cost of the water system.</p>\n<p><em>\u2014With files from Rod Link</em></p>",

The crossing needs maintenance after CN learned the rails were moving as vehicles drove across it, a City staff report to council said. Further investigation revealed that the ties beneath the crossing are completely rotten, so much of the rail infrastructure at the crossing must be replaced.</p>\n<p>The $182,000 repair estimate comes from CN, who are planning the maintenance work.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Mayor Sean Bujtas expressed his deep frustration with the situation.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is an agreement that\u2026 was signed when I was three years old, and here we are stuck to this agreement,\u201d Bujtas said at an Oct. 14 council meeting. \u201cI\u2019m not happy with CN\u2026 $182,000 to CN is nothing. To this community, it\u2019s a lot of money.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to a report presented to council by City staff, railway crossing agreements are not typically renegotiated unless one party proposes physical changes to the crossing, and maintenance is not counted under that category.</p>\n<p>While approving the payment to allow the necessary work to proceed, the mayor pledged to fight the agreement at higher levels of government.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy suggestion is we move forward with this recommendation\u2026 but then we take it to other levels,\u201d he said. \u201cWe take it to the Province, and we take it to the feds and say, \u2018you guys need to get involved and change these agreements,\u2019 because how can I be held accountable to something that was signed when I was a three year old? It\u2019s not reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p>Councillor Sarah Zimmerman echoed the mayor\u2019s sentiments.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cIt\u2019s absurd that we need to be held to account to something that was signed in 1979,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s insane to think that we\u2019re bound in perpetuity to something that was signed almost 50 years ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>A timeline for construction has not yet been established.</p>",

I don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s sad. It\u2019s sad for Terrace.\u201d</p>\n<p>The council had previously discussed a staff report stating it was not feasible to enter an agreement with a third-party group to take over the building, as the city could not be absolved of liability given the unknown extent of the damage.</p>",

She described her tour of LNG Canada as crucial to understanding the scale and complexity of the facility.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to really understand what it means until you see it,\u201d she said. \u201c50,000 people contributed to that project.

The opportunity in front of us is significant.\u201d</p>\n<p>She toured the under-construction Ridley Island Energy Export Facility (REEF) and other expansion areas at the port.</p>\n<p>\u201cEighteen months ago, they were just speaking about it,\u201d she said. \u201cNow it\u2019s nearing completion.
