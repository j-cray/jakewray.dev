  "content_html": "<p>A 986-hectare wildfire is burning along the north shore of the Nechako Reservoir, near Little Andrews Bay. No evacuation alerts or orders were listed on the site. The fire is approximately 15 kilometres west of the community Wistaria. Another wildfire discovered on June 8 east of Ootsa Lake, suspected to be caused by a tree falling on power lines, was extinguished June 9 thanks to the hard work of local volunteers. The Little Andrews Bay fire, first discovered June 8, was considered out of control by the BC Wildfire Service. This designation, still in effect at the time of writing on June 12, means the wildfire is anticipated to spread. There was light rain on June 12 and the fire would likely grow at a slower pace than in previous days, according to a bulletin posted on the BC Wildfire Service website, which would aid in efforts to combat the fire. \u201cFirefighting crews and aviation resources will continue to focus on establishing guard around the head of the fire and using direct attack by applying water directly to the fire to keep it south of the Andrews Bay Forest Service Road, as well as containing all areas where the fire has already crossed the Forest Service Road,\u201d the bulletin said.
