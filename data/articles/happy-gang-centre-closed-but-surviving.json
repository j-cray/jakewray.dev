It closed mid-March in response to the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Members are welcome to reach out to the Centre if they need assistance with shopping or other daily tasks, Cowman wrote. The board of directors is also seeking nominations for its annual scholarship presented to a graduating high school student.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe ask that you provide a name and a resume to the Happy Gang if you are aware of anyone,\u201d Cowman wrote.</p>\n<p>The Centre remains financially stable, Cowman wrote, but there are some looming expenses.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have some extraordinary expenses coming up, which includes repairs to the basement, due to the water damage, and insurance renewal,\u201d he wrote.</p>\n<p>In an interview with <em>The Terrace Standard,</em> Cowman said an accumulation of snow on the Centre\u2019s roof this past winter lead to a flood in the basement.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cIt was pretty cold all winter, and then suddenly we got a huge amount of rain, and it melted all the snow,\u201d he said, adding that the roof drains were plugged so all the water poured over the side of the building, then leaked into the basement. \u201cAll the gyprock on the north wall needs to be replaced.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cowman\u2019s bulletin said the Happy Gang is applying for some financial supports to help sustain it through the pandemic.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe do have continuing operating expenses \u2013 heat, light, cable but [we have] applied for the BC Hydro for their small business grant to help with hydro and the Centre has applied for federal funding to cover our shortfall expected over the summer months,\u201d he wrote.</p>\n<p>The Centre is down to 60 per cent of its usual membership, which has stung the finances a bit, according to Cowman.</p>\n<p>But some existing members responded to Cowman\u2019s bulletin when it was posted to Facebook.</p>\n<p>\u201cI sure miss all you guys. And the lunches,\u201d wrote Gwyneth Pritchard.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",
