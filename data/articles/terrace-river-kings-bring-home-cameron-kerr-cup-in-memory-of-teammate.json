  "content_html": "<p>The Terrace River Kings traveled over 800 kilometres, and battled through a best-of-three series to win the Central Interior Hockey League (CIHL) Senior AA championship in memory of their former teammate Cameron Kerr.</p>\n<p>The River Kings travelled to Williams Lake March 16-17, to win the Cameron Kerr Memorial Cup in overtime Sunday afternoon. With seven minutes left on the clock, and solid chances from both teams, the River Kings found the back of the net in overtime to win 4-3. The Kings bench errupted in cheers, as the teammates threw their gloves and helmets in the air, and hugged one another after the hard-fought win.</p>\n<p>As the team were celebarting in the dressing room and preparing for the nine-hour bus ride home, River Kings coach Derek Jurista said it was hard to put into words what the win meaned to them.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cWe wanted to win it for [Cam] and that was our motivation to win this trophy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kerr was a sheet metal worker by trade, but he was also a former player for the Terrace River Kings and an avid outdoorsman who loved paddling, hunting and fishing and was known for being kind and compassionate.</p>\n<p>Kerr was struck and killed by oncoming traffic in a hit and run Nov. 18, 2018 as he walked along Highway 16 near Terrace. An RCMP investigation turned up evidence at the time, identifying a group of suspects from the Lower Mainland who may have colluded to cover up the incident.</p>\n<p>The case remains unsolved.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt can\u2019t put it into words. It\u2019s feels awesome.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.terracestandard.com/news/family-of-cameron-kerr-still-waiting-for-answers-two-years-after-fatal-hit-and-run-6052202\" target=\"_blank\">Family of Cameron Kerr still waiting for answers two years after fatal hit-and-run</a></p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p><em>\u2013 With a file from Jake Wray/Terrace Standard</em></p>",
