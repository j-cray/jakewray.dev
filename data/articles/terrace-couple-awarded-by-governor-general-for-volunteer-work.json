  "content_html": "<p>A husband and wife team in Thornhill have each been awarded medals by Governor General Julie Payette for their volunteer service.</p>\n<p>The Governor General released a list July 1 naming 123 Canadians who are being recognized this year for honourable conduct.</p>\n<p>Ron and Mavis Ramsey, the Thornhill couple, were awarded the Meritorious Service Medal for founding and running the Helping Hands of Terrace Society, which collects recycling and donates the proceeds to help people with medical costs.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>The society began as a way to help seniors with prescription costs, but over the years has helped people of all ages with a variety of medical needs. The society has put money toward medical equipment such as wheelchairs and travel costs for people needing to access Mills Memorial Hospital.</p>\n<p>Mavis told <em>The Terrace Standard</em> that receiving the award was \u201cshocking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t doing this for a medal or a big recognition like this, but it happened\u201d she said. \u201cWell, we\u2019re both quite honoured by it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Ramseys founded the Helping Hands Society about ten years ago, though prior to that they volunteered their assembling bundles of kindling that were sold with proceeds going to the Dr. REM Lee Hospital Foundation. Mavis said the pair are still going strong and they don\u2019t plan to stop volunteering any time soon. Mavis is 71 and Ron is 79.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep doing it for as long as we can,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s rewarding seeing that seniors are getting help and they\u2019re not dying because they don\u2019t have to make a choice between food, rent and medication \u2026 And same with people with sick kids.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arrangements have yet to be made for a formal awarding ceremony and the Ramseys have not received the physical medals yet. Mavis said they were invited to Ottawa but could not travel there for medical reasons. A press release from the Governor General\u2019s office states that award ceremonies will be held \u201cwhen global circumstances permit.\u201d</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",
