  "content_html": "<p>A family group was rescued by Terrace Search and Rescue (SAR) early in the morning of June 29 after spending the night on the bank of Lakelse River following a tubing mishap.</p>\n<p>A mother and three kids set out on the river June 28 believing it would be a leisurely ride, according to Dave Jephson, vice-president of Terrace SAR.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey started to make their way down the Lakelse River, and at some point in time they started to encounter the numerous logjams that are on the water,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter climbing over so many logjams, obviously it got dark, traveling wasn\u2019t safe any more, they tried to find a road to walk out to, but couldn\u2019t find one, so they went back to the edge of the river so they could be in a safe spot.\u201d</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>The mother\u2019s husband was waiting downriver to pick the group up, and when they didn\u2019t show he contacted police. Terrace SAR was called in around 11:30 p.m. and began searching near the canyon on Lakelse River where the group had initially set out from.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe started searching from the canyon, the back logging roads, realizing it\u2019s just a gnarly section of river to search, and we were going to need daylight,\u201d Jephson said.</p>\n<p>Terrace SAR regrouped and planned to set out with a helicopter at first light on June 29, Jephson said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe took off and located one tube first, in a logjam. The searchers kept going and then that\u2019s when they spotted the individuals on the shoreline,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>The group was unprepared for a night in the woods, Jephson said, but they improvised to keep warm.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat thinking, at some point they cut the tube up and wrapped themselves up with it at night, and that kept them warm,\u201d he said.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Jephson said Lakelse River is not safe for tubing.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a non-recreational river,\u201d he said.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",
