  "content_html": "<p>A Rosswood resident hopes that a first-ever Terrace to Rosswood marathon she organized on May 23 will become an annual event.</p>\n<p>Kimberly Girard was one of a handful of runners who participated and one of just two who ran the full 42 kilometres. Experienced local runner Brent Webb was the other runner completing the distance while Girard\u2019s husband, Stephan, ran half, and one more runner joined for the final 12 kilometres.</p>\n<p>The route began at Coast Mountain College and ended at the Girards\u2019 home in Rosswood. It was a casual event, but the runners gave it a title because they hope to do it again next year \u2014 perhaps in the other direction.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Kimberly Girard said she had been thinking of running from Terrace to Rosswood since last year.</p>\n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t run that far then, but it\u2019s amazing what you can do when you just chip away at it.\u201d</p>\n<p>She began marathon training in December for a separate, official race, but it was cancelled in response to the pandemic. That\u2019s when she started planning the Terrace to Rosswood run.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll of our races were cancelled. It\u2019s kind of like, what do you do with the training that you have?\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>At first, she planned to do the run alone.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was like, I don\u2019t know, it might be better to suffer alone,\u201d she said with a laugh.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Then Webb offered to join.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s run, I don\u2019t know, like 10 marathons or something,\u201d Girard said. \u201cHe can run much faster than I can, so he was there purely to support me.\u201d</p>\n<p>She finished the run in 3 hours and 48 minutes. Nothing spectacular, she said, but she was pleased with the result. Conditions were ideal for the run, Girard said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was awesome, not too hot. I thought it was going be even cooler and rainy, but it wasn\u2019t,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Girard said she used to run about 15 years ago, before having children. She got back into running a year ago, when she and her husband participated in the Skeena River Relay. She had done weight training and felt fit, but hadn\u2019t trained for running.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was trying to prove that my fitness would transfer over to running, which it really doesn\u2019t, at all, because [the relay] was very painful. I finished [the relay] but, yeah, it wasn\u2019t pretty,\u201d she laughed. \u201cEver since then I\u2019ve just been hooked on running further.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Terrace to Rosswood marathon was exactly one year after her return to running.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",
