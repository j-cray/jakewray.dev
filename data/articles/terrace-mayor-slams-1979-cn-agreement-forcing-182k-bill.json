  "content_html": "<p>Terrace city council has reluctantly approved a payment of $182,000 to CN Rail for maintenance on the Kenney Street railway crossing, mandated by an agreement signed decades before most of the council was involved in politics.</p>\n<p>The agreement, dated Jan. 30, 1979, obligates the City to pay for maintenance on the crossing. The crossing needs maintenance after CN learned the rails were moving as vehicles drove across it, a City staff report to council said. Further investigation revealed that the ties beneath the crossing are completely rotten, so much of the rail infrastructure at the crossing must be replaced.</p>\n<p>The $182,000 repair estimate comes from CN, who are planning the maintenance work.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Mayor Sean Bujtas expressed his deep frustration with the situation.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is an agreement that\u2026 was signed when I was three years old, and here we are stuck to this agreement,\u201d Bujtas said at an Oct. 14 council meeting. \u201cI\u2019m not happy with CN\u2026 $182,000 to CN is nothing. To this community, it\u2019s a lot of money.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to a report presented to council by City staff, railway crossing agreements are not typically renegotiated unless one party proposes physical changes to the crossing, and maintenance is not counted under that category.</p>\n<p>While approving the payment to allow the necessary work to proceed, the mayor pledged to fight the agreement at higher levels of government.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy suggestion is we move forward with this recommendation\u2026 but then we take it to other levels,\u201d he said. \u201cWe take it to the Province, and we take it to the feds and say, \u2018you guys need to get involved and change these agreements,\u2019 because how can I be held accountable to something that was signed when I was a three year old? It\u2019s not reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p>Councillor Sarah Zimmerman echoed the mayor\u2019s sentiments.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cIt\u2019s absurd that we need to be held to account to something that was signed in 1979,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s insane to think that we\u2019re bound in perpetuity to something that was signed almost 50 years ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>A timeline for construction has not yet been established.</p>",
