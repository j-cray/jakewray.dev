    "content_html": "<p>Six million dollars are once again on the line for Terrace and Kitselas First Nation.</p>\n<p>Taisheng International Investment Services, the former developer of the Skeena Industrial Development Park (SIDP), is appealing a court decision from October 2025 that saw a joint venture between the City of Terrace and Kitselas First Nation keep a $6 million construction deposit from Taisheng after the developer did not build a groundwater system at the SIDP.</p>\n<p>Court documents obtained by <em>The Terrace Standard</em> show that an appeal was filed in November 2025 but do not list an argument for the appeal. Representatives of Taisheng Internatioal Investment Services did not respond to request for comment by press deadline.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>A spokesperson for the City of Terrace confirmed the City is still in litigation for the $6 million, and said that the City is currently lobbying higher levels of government for money to get the groundwater system built at the SIDP.</p>\n<p>“Based on Taisheng incomplete drawings it is believed very rough (no quotes involved yet) $32 million dollar cost to get water in the park,” the spokesperson said in an email. “Hence, we are in the process of lobbying the government for a package of money that won’t set Terrace back even further.”</p>\n<p>The decision in October dismissed a lawsuit from Taisheng International Investment Services seeking to recover the $6 million deposit. The judge, Justice Underhill, stated that Taisheng was not entitled to the return of the deposit after it failed to meet contractual deadlines, which ultimately led the City of Terrace to repurchase the lands.</p>\n<p>“To find otherwise,” the justice wrote, “would result in Taisheng receiving a $6.18 million windfall.”</p>\n<p>The case originates from a 2014 agreement where Taisheng agreed to purchase 1,187 acres of land from the city for $11.878 million. The contract required Taisheng to develop the lands into an industrial park, which included constructing a road and a groundwater system.</p>\n<p>Under the agreement, Taisheng was eligible for reimbursements for this infrastructure work if it met specific deadlines. The city agreed to reimburse Taisheng approximately $6.18 million for the construction of the groundwater system.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>By 2019, with the system still not built, the parties executed an amendment to their contract. In a transaction that occurred on June 28, 2019, the City of Terrace paid Taisheng the $6,183,686.80 “groundwater reimbursement.” On the same day, Taisheng paid the exact same amount back to the city, where it was held as a “construction deposit” to be used as security for the completion of the water system.</p>\n<p>According to the court decision, Taisheng failed to meet the construction milestones set out in the development plan. As a result, the City of Terrace exercised its option to purchase the land back on Oct. 15, 2021, a move that was validated in a separate arbitration proceeding. The lands were officially transferred back to the city on Oct. 4, 2023.</p>\n<p>A day later, Taisheng demanded the return of its $6.18 million deposit, arguing that since the city now owned the land, it could not use the deposit for its intended purpose. In a joint statement, the City of Terrace and Kitselas First Nation confirmed the “construction deposit will be retained by the Joint Venture to be used on the park’s groundwater system,” which is now estimated to cost over $14 million.</p>\n<p>Taisheng argued that the contract’s terms meant the deposit could only be used for work “attributable to the purchaser” (Taisheng) and that the city exercising its buy-back option made this impossible. Justice Underhill rejected this interpretation, calling it “commercially absurd.” He found the contract’s language was “clear and unambiguous” that the money was security.</p>\n<p>“The intention of the parties, reflected in the language of the purchase agreement, is clear,” the decision said. “The purpose of the transaction was to see the SIDP developed, and it was expressly structured to secure Taisheng’s commitments to proceed with that development in a timely manner, failing which Terrace could repurchase the lands.”</p>\n<p>The judge also dismissed Taisheng’s alternative argument that keeping the deposit amounted to an “unenforceable penalty.” He ruled the deposit was not “unconscionable” or “penal,” especially given the high cost of the water system.</p>\n<p><em>—With files from Rod Link</em></p>",

To this community, it’s a lot of money.”</p>\n<p>According to a report presented to council by City staff, railway crossing agreements are not typically renegotiated unless one party proposes physical changes to the crossing, and maintenance is not counted under that category.</p>\n<p>While approving the payment to allow the necessary work to proceed, the mayor pledged to fight the agreement at higher levels of government.</p>\n<p>“My suggestion is we move forward with this recommendation… but then we take it to other levels,” he said. “We take it to the Province, and we take it to the feds and say, ‘you guys need to get involved and change these agreements,’ because how can I be held accountable to something that was signed when I was a three year old? It’s not reasonable.”</p>\n<p>Councillor Sarah Zimmerman echoed the mayor’s sentiments.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>“It’s absurd that we need to be held to account to something that was signed in 1979,” she said. “It’s insane to think that we’re bound in perpetuity to something that was signed almost 50 years ago.”</p>\n<p>A timeline for construction has not yet been established.</p>",

The Terrace Men’s Shed had previously offered to take over maintenance of the building.</p>\n<p>“The Men’s Shed would be covering it through funding,” he said. “It’s a win for you guys, and you’re throwing it away. I don’t get it. It’s sad. It’s sad for Terrace.”</p>\n<p>The council had previously discussed a staff report stating it was not feasible to enter an agreement with a third-party group to take over the building, as the city could not be absolved of liability given the unknown extent of the damage.</p>",

It’s totally another thing to see it.”</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Bailey said touring facilities is critical to her decision-making because reading about the projects from Victoria only goes so far. She described her tour of LNG Canada as crucial to understanding the scale and complexity of the facility.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to really understand what it means until you see it,” she said. “50,000 people contributed to that project. There’s now about 1,000 on the ground, and if LNG Canada Phase 2 goes ahead, you’ll see that giant workforce again.”</p>\n<p>Premier David Eby toured the LNG Canada site in Kitimat in July and touted the second phase of the project, which would see the pipeline and export facility approximately double their capacity.</p>\n<p>“I’m very much looking forward to coming back here and making the announcement of an LNG Canada Phase 2,” Eby said at the time.</p>\n<p>Bailey said her trip followed the premier’s own because many of the same projects are now at critical stages of development.</p>\n<p>“Our premier says British Columbia is going to become the economic driver of Canada, and that really is his vision,” Bailey said. “At this time, when we have a trade war and our most reliable trade partner has turned on us, it’s a real opportunity for us to step into that moment as British Columbians.”</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Bailey said the combination of high tariffs on lumber exports and growing Asian demand for energy and minerals means the province must strengthen other markets and supply chains.</p>\n<p>“We have to make sure that we’re becoming self-sufficient in our economy and not as reliant on the U.S.,” she said. “This part of the world is a huge part of that solution.”</p>\n<p>Asked about environmental concerns tied to resource development, Bailey said the province aims to lead globally in reducing emissions intensity while maintaining high environmental standards.</p>\n<p>“Our LNG is much lower-carbon than comparative LNGs around the world,” she said. “When Cedar comes online, it’s actually going to be the lowest-carbon LNG because it’s produced with electricity.”</p>\n<p>She added that B.C. has 17 of the critical minerals needed for electrification and that recent clean-energy project approvals included significant Indigenous ownership.</p>\n<p>“Doing this work in conjunction with building the economy, ensuring partnership with nations, and doing it in the least environmentally harmful way possible is the way forward,” she said.</p>\n<p>At the Port of Prince Rupert, Bailey said she was struck by how quickly expansion projects have advanced since her last visit in 2023.</p>\n<p>“Every time I’ve been to the port, it’s more developed,” she said. “We shave off 10 days of transportation compared to the Port of Los Angeles, and each day represents about $100,000 for a container ship. The opportunity in front of us is significant.”</p>\n<p>She toured the under-construction Ridley Island Energy Export Facility (REEF) and other expansion areas at the port.</p>\n<p>“Eighteen months ago, they were just speaking about it,” she said. “Now it’s nearing completion. The opportunities are huge.”</p>\n<p>Bailey said continuing to visit northern communities will remain a priority as major projects reshape the province’s economic and environmental landscape.</p>\n<p><em>—With files from Quinn Bender</em></p>",

We’re doing our best but it does start to weigh on the staff.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are running on fumes for way too many of our shifts.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hospital staff feel frustrated as many of the COVID-19 patients they are treating seem to have not followed public health protocols, Dr. McCoach said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A lot of the cases are from people not doing their part at the societal level and they’re still partying, they’re still socializing, they’re still not taking the pandemic seriously in the way it needs to be, and unfortunately [hospital staff] are suffering because of that,” he said. “It really does threaten the stability of our health care system if COVID is allowed to run unchecked. I think people need to get that message a little bit clearer.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s not a hoax. It’s not influenza. It’s not just a flu season that will go away. It is something that needs to be taken seriously, and really the fate of our medical system remains in the public’s hands.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Dr. McCoach acknowledged the difficulties that come with pandemic safety measures.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We know people are tired. It’s not an easy thing to ask,” he said. “There are real harms from changing the way we socialize and interact but, fundamentally, this remains in [the public’s] hands.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There have been COVID-19-related deaths at Mills Memorial Hospital, Dr. McCoach said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When you see people that got sick sometimes having done the right thing, doing their best to stay at home, doing their best to isolate … Seeing people like that get sick, that is very demoralizing,” he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dr. McCoach said fewer than 20 hospital staff have received vaccines so far, but its arrival still provides some hope on the horizon for staff.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked what the public can do to help the situation and support front-line staff, beyond adhering to public health protocols, Dr. McCoach said simple gestures of gratitude would be immensely helpful.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There is a very large team of people as well that are putting in a lot of extra hours, from pharmacy staff, physio staff, occupational therapy, the public health teams … the housekeeping staff who have gone above and beyond the call of duty,” he said. “If you know somebody, send a little message just to say thank you. It is very, very difficult and demoralizing right now, and we need the extra thank-yous.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Especially the nurses — they have moved mountains to make sure the community remains safe.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.thenorthernview.com/news/its-not-a-hoax-terrace-hospital-busier-than-ever-with-covid-19-cases-5978773\">The Terrace Standard.</a></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n </div>",

(Photo courtesy Ronnie Sampare)</figcaption></figure>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nisga’a rapper produces podcast in the Nass Valley</h4>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jan. 29, 2021</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By Jake Wray</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ronnie Sampare goes by many names.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His Nisga’a name is Gwinayee, which means ‘determination.’ His rapper name is The Truth.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I like to say the stuff that other folks are scared to say,” he told <em>The Terrace Standard</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 31-year-old was born in Terrace and grew up in the Nass Valley. He overcame struggles with drugs, alcohol and the hard life in his youth and now aims to be a positive influence.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One means of achieving that is through his art. Sampare is obsessed with hip-hop, having produced 15 mixtapes and two albums under his solo moniker, and he hosts a free hip-hop podcast called the Smoke House Radio which he produces from his home in Laxgalts’ap (Greenville) in the Nass Valley.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When I started pointing out the bad … the really obvious horrible [stuff] that’s in our community, people started listening to my music,” he said. “Like if I said ‘if you’re selling hard drugs in my community, don’t be surprised if I point you out.’”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I don’t want no one ever poisoning my fellow man in our community because I lived that life when I was younger.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Sampare was eight years old, his father passed away and he went to live with his grandparents. In his later teenage years, he became mixed up with drugs and alcohol.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I lived in Terrace. I lived in the ‘hood. I was a mean person back then,” he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But that life quickly grew stale. Fourteen years ago he quit hard drugs and he’s been sober from alcohol for 10 years.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I have a lot of youth that are in my family. I’ve seen them get scared of other people that are intoxicated, and I did not want that to be me,” he said. “I didn’t want to be known as a drunk or a drug-dealer or just this gangster-ass person to the community.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s just the rut that Indigenous [people] get caught up in or stereotyped as, and I don’t want that. Ever. I wish the best for everyone, always.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sampare first became obsessed with hip-hop when he heard his cousin freestyling years ago.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“He was smoking some weed and drinking at a party and he was freestyling, and I was like ‘what the hell?!’” Sampare said. “I watched him and my [other] cousin, because they were like a duo, I watched them dual like Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, they’d feed off each other’s energy, rap bar for bar, and I was just amazed with it.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“After that, I just started studying everything.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He made his cousin teach him how to write verses and choruses. With no formal training in music or audio production, he bought a microphone and a Macbook and just started making music. The early stuff is “crap,” Sampare said with a laugh, but eventually he started to get the hang of it.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He spent some time as a member of a local hip-hop group called North Side Connect Gang (NSCG). The group had been trying, without success, to get airplay on radio stations like CBC Radio and CFNR, so they started podcasting for exposure.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We were trying to get on radio stations but we couldn’t so we just started the podcast to network with other artists throughout Canada, and it just sort of blew up,” he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eventually, Sampare had a falling out with other members of the band, so he rebranded and went his own direction. That’s when The Smoke House Radio was born. The podcast is a mix of hip-hop music, some news and random information from throughout the internet, cannabis culture and video game culture.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The name of the podcast is certainly a reference to cannabis culture, but Sampare said the name came to him when he was in a literal smoke house.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was in the smoke house with a load of fish, I think there was like 90 fish up over my head, and I was like ‘where there’s smoke, there’s fire. You smoke your food … Everything relates around the smoke house.’”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Smoke House Radio averages between 2,000 and 4,000 plays per episode, with listeners around the world. Only 14 per cent of listeners are from Canada, while 33 per cent of listeners are in the United States and 15 per cent are from Germany. Sampare figures he has about 900 listeners in the Nass Valley and about 90 in Terrace.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The podcast is entirely free and Sampare said it will always stay that way.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Once I start charging money for it, it’s just going to be haywire,” he said, noting he’s wary of the pitfalls that come with having an audience. “I don’t want to break relationships or step on people while my show is getting huge.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sampare said he’s eager to grow the podcast audience and he has plans to start publishing more music (most of which hasn’t been officially released) on platforms such as music streaming giant Spotify under the small label GetALifeRecords, which Sampare runs with his younger brother and frequent collaborator Eric Sampare, also known as Lyrical E.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prior to the pandemic, the brothers were booking shows in the Northwest with Dosed-Up Entertainment, an entertainment management company based in Houston, B.C. With live shows cancelled due to COVID-19, the pair are focused on writing and producing more tracks.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nevertheless, Sampare can’t wait to perform again.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you can get a person to relate to your music and come to your shows and meet you, it is the greatest feeling in the world.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To listen to The Truth, head to <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ronniesampare?utm_source=terrace%20standard&amp;utm_campaign=terrace%20standard%3A%20outbound&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">soundcloud.com/ronniesampare</a> and to listen to the Smoke House Radio head to <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/ronnie-sampare?utm_source=terrace%20standard&amp;utm_campaign=terrace%20standard%3A%20outbound&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">anchor.fm/ronnie-sampare/</a> or look in your favourite podcast app.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.terracestandard.com/community/skeena-voices-everything-relates-around-the-smoke-house-6053288\">The Terrace Standard.</a></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n </div>",

Organizers said the rally was also to raise awareness for missing and murdered Indigenous women. Some demonstrators held signs bearing the name of Chantel Moore, a 26-year-old Indigenous woman from Vancouver Island who was shot and killed by police in New Brunswick on June 4 after moving there to be closer to her five-year-old daughter.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chants including “no justice, no peace,” and “black lives matter” were punctuated by heavy gusts of wind, though it was clear and sunny. Plenty of demonstrators wore medical masks and some wore gloves. Many cars driving past on Eby St. honked, with some drivers and passengers giving thumbs-up to indicate support.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A handful of demonstrators took up a megaphone to share stories and messages with the crowd.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mina Lwal told the crowd she had faced racism at school in Kitimat.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They referred to me as ‘the ugly black girl.’ … Every time I walked down the hall, I’d hear them whispering, or behind my back in group chats they’d talk about it,” she said. “You know what, I’m owning it today. I’m not an ugly black girl, I’m for sure a beautiful South-Sudanese woman living in Canada today, in front of all of you.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lwal asked the crowd to be as loud as they possibly could for all the chants that day.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This movement is not going anywhere, and we, as a people, are not going anywhere because we’re strong,” she said. “We are all one race, and that’s the human race, and we all deserve to get treated as equal because at the end of the day, I bleed the same as you do, and I cry the same as you do.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amber Webb, who is black, shared with the crowd some words written by her father.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A group of National Guard members went down on one knee in solidarity … This is what we need, rather than the hatred and violence spewing out of the White House which poisons the US, Canada, and the world,” she said. “Our government, cowering inside our houses of Parliament, lacking the courage to stand up to a bully or call a lie a lie, is not anything to admire.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Webb’s father’s words also touched upon economic inequality.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“At the heart of all of this, our countries have become quasi-democracies, where the real power lies within the wealthiest ten per cent. If we do not serve them, they will hurt us,” she said to the crowd. “Surely we will look at the bullying power and luxurious life of the few, beside the poverty, suffering and powerlessness and ask ‘can we allow this modern form of slavery to continue?’”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There were some criticisms of the rally voiced in the comments of a post in the Terrace Community Bulletin Board on Facebook (though most comments were supportive.)</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I absolutely think there should be non-violent protests, but not for this. There is significantly more black-on-black crime and no one bats an eye. Where are your protests when that happens?” wrote Brittany Joyce. “What are you accomplishing?”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One commenter raised safety concerns regarding the pandemic.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I hope folks are maintaining proper social distancing,” wrote Warren Wilson.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the organizers of the event, Shea Kurisu, acknowledged the risk of gathering a crowd during this pandemic but said the rally was essential work. Organizers handed out free masks to demonstrators. Ultimately, Kurisu said, demonstrators were each responsible for their own safety.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kurisu said she organized the event because her husband and two children are people of colour.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I see the injustices that people of colour live with every single day, and I wanted to use my white privilege and my voice to raise the voices of those that aren’t being heard,” she said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jillian Kofoed, who organized the event alongside Kurisu, said she organized the event because she hasn’t done enough to stand up to racism.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Silence is compliance. I am not a racist, but I never said anything against racism,” she said. “We’re continuing to educate ourselves about all of it, we’re not perfect, we’ve still got a lot to learn. That’s part of the reason why we’re doing this today is because we needed to hear the voices of the people that this affects first-hand.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.terracestandard.com/news/anti-racism-demonstration-held-in-terrace/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Terrace Standard.</a></p>\n </div>",

(Facebook Photo)</figcaption></figure>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Persons of interest questioned, not enough evidence to pursue charges</h4>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dec. 10, 2020</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By Jake Wray</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The question ‘what if?’ has haunted Garrett Kerr for more than two years now.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His brother, Cameron Kerr, 30, was killed in a hit and run in the early hours of Nov. 18, 2018 while walking home after drinking. Cameron was a sheet metal worker by trade, but he was also a former player for the Terrace River Kings hockey team and an avid outdoorsman who loved paddling, hunting and fishing. Everyone knew he was kind and compassionate and he had a tremendous sense of humour, Garrett says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The driver of the vehicle has not been caught, despite a rigorous RCMP investigation that has turned up significant evidence and identified a group of suspects from the Lower Mainland who may have colluded to cover up the incident.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garrett and Cameron were together that night and when speaking to Garrett it’s clear he has asked himself over and over what he could have done differently, as so many people do when they grieve such a loss — particularly when the investigation is incomplete, leaving the family with few answers.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The night Cameron was killed, the brothers had attended a wake for a friend who died young of an overdose. Friends and family had gathered for a bittersweet night of sharing memories, Garrett says, at a home in New Remo.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Cameron was ready to leave, he decided to walk home to Terrace along Hwy 16. It’s a long walk, but not unfamiliar to the brothers, who grew up in New Remo. Before Cameron left, he had a conversation with Garrett in the driveway. Garrett tried to convince him to wait for a cab or to sleep at their parents’ home in New Remo.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Cameron wanted to walk, so Garrett let him go and returned to the party.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An oncoming vehicle struck Cameron shortly after he left as he walked against traffic on the shoulder of the highway, according to the RCMP. The driver and companions took hours to cover up the incident before continuing northwest along the highway, the Kerr family says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A while after Cameron left, Garrett and a group of friends piled into a cab and headed toward Terrace. There was an energetic mood in the cab, Garrett says, and nobody was paying attention to the ditch on the opposite side of the road.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I still don’t know to this day whether my brother was alive when I rode by in the cab,” Garrett says, his voice breaking, in a recent interview with <em>The Terrace Standard</em>. “The longer these guys hold out and don’t co-operate, the longer I have to live with that.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cameron’s body was found in the ditch around noon by a member of the public.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garrett had been trying to reach Cameron that morning and had gone by Cameron’s place to find he wasn’t home. Then Garrett drove back out toward New Remo with a sinking feeling in his gut.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I had made most of the drive out there wondering,” he says. “And sure enough I came around the next corner and there was a police stoppage and police tape.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Police quickly identified a suspect vehicle, a 2011-2016 Ford F350 pickup truck. Tips from the public lead police to discover an abandoned boat trailer associated with the case.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then on Nov. 21, just days after Cameron was killed, police announced they had identified a truck on Haida Gwaii with damage consistent with the collision and said they were confident they had identified a suspect driver who was from the Lower Mainland. They seized the suspect F350 truck, another truck and two boat trailers (in addition to the abandoned boat trailer discovered earlier). Police questioned seven people who may have been involved in the incident.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, nothing. The RCMP didn’t quite have enough evidence to recommend charges. Garrett and his family held a press conference on Dec. 19, one month after Cameron was killed, appealing for people to come forward with information.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They were joined by Sgt. Shawn McLaughlin, the primary RCMP member on the case.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We will not relent until we deliver the driver responsible [and he] is brought to justice,” Sgt. McLaughlin said at the press conference. “The last thing I want to see is that those responsible, or those that are hiding evidence … enjoying their Christmas while forgetting the faces of those you see here today.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">RCMP conducted a search for evidence along Hwy 16 in April 2019, once weather conditions permitted, aided by members of Terrace and Prince Rupert Search and Rescue organizations. The search yielded several pertinent items, police said, though they did not disclose the nature of the items.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since then, the Kerr family has remained focused on asking the suspects, as well as the suspects’ families and friends, to come forward with information. The Kerr family held another public appeal press conference (their third) in November 2019, about a year after Cameron was killed.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And they paid for a letter to be published in Lower Mainland newspapers in April 2020, summarizing their understanding of the incident and pleading for associates of the suspects to come forward.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“To the parents, wives, girlfriends and friends of a group of men from the Lower Mainland: In November 2018, these men set off for a fishing and hunting trip to Haida Gwaii,” the letter begins.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“After passing through Terrace, they were involved in a tragic collision … after the collision, they spent hours hiding their damaged boat trailer in the woods … they transferred the boat to the new trailer and proceeded to Haida Gwaii as if nothing had happened. The persons responsible for his death knowingly left Cameron to die alone, not caring enough to call for help.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Their trucks, boats and trailers were all impounded by the police, so when they returned to the Lower Mainland, it was without those possessions … If you recognize these men by this story, the family of Cameron Kerr pleads with you to urge [the suspects] to do the right thing and go to the authorities so that this nightmare can end for Cameron’s family, as well as these individuals.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garrett says the family does not blame the RCMP for the fact that the investigation has not been concluded and they are grateful for the work the RCMP have done.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But they still want justice.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There is a part of the grieving process that is not available to us while this is hanging over our heads,” he says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sgt. McLaughlin, speaking to <em>The Terrace Standard</em> on Dec. 2, 2020, says he can’t share many details of the current status of the investigation, but he says police are not sitting idly waiting for someone to come forward.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I wouldn’t say we’re at a dead end in that regard,” he says. “There’s possible other means that I can’t get into that we might resort to.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He says the RCMP are keeping the Kerr family in the loop as much as possible.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That’s been a strong goal of ours is to make sure that we’re engaged with the family because we do realize it’s been two years and they want that assurance and they deserve that assurance to know that this hasn’t fallen off our plate,” he says. “We are still continuing to investigate and use various means to do so.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sgt. McLaughlin added that the investigation has shown police that Cameron was very well respected in his community.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s a very important file to the community and it’s a very important file to our membership here,” he says. “It’s really close to our hearts and we’re working on it the best we can every day.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The River Kings held tributes to Cameron at home games in 2018 and 2019 and the community showed up in force to both games. Each year, the Terrace Pipes and Drums Society performed at the games in commemoration of Cameron’s Scottish heritage. The team likely would have held a tribute again this year but the league cancelled its season due to the pandemic.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Steve Cullis, captain of the River Kings, is a friend of Garrett and Cameron’s. He was with the brothers at the wake the night Cameron was killed.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It was pretty tough news,” he says. “I want some closure for the family more than anything. How long do they have to keep guessing as to what exactly happened?”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garrett says the grief of losing his brother comes in waves.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The first couple of months it’s just like nothing you could have ever imagined. Then you sort of get to where you just have to be able to function in your life,” he says. “There are times when I’m just angry … I don’t know. You just aren’t ever going to be the same.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“At the same time, I don’t think Cameron would have wanted us all to be in that sort of head space forever either.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In November of this year, near the anniversary of Cameron’s death, a small group of family and friends went to the spot where his body was found to visit a memorial. It’s made of antlers, to repesent his love of hunting, his fishing rod, and kayaking oars to represent his love of paddling.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cameron would have wanted those who love him to come together to support each other in grief, Garrett says, so they have strived to do that, even though it’s been challenging during the pandemic. And Cameron would have wanted them to laugh together.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“He was one of the funniest people you’d ever know,” Garrett says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garrett has so many wonderful memories of his brother from over the years, and often it’s the more recent happy memories that come to his mind. He recalls time they spent running together, and laughs as he admits Cameron was the better runner.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’d spend a bit of time training for the King of the Mountain [foot race] or just running for the heck of it,” he says. “When I want to really remember him, I try to go run around Terrace Mountain and feel like I’m getting my ass kicked, because I certainly felt that way when I was running with him.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garrett is thankful to the Terrace area community for its support.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Everybody up here thinks about Cameron all the time and they’ve been so helpful in the investigation,” he says. “But really the people that can make a difference at this point are living their lives down south.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>– With files from Natalia Balcerzak</em></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em><strong>Police are asking anyone with information and who has not already spoken with police to call Sgt.

Photo courtesy Natasha Candelora.</figcaption></figure>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">B.C. ministry unhelpful in aftermath of fire, family says</h4>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nov. 18, 2020</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By Jake Wray</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Natasha Candelora left her house in Old Remo around 5:10 p.m. on Oct. 7 to take her two children into town for Taekwondo practice. Within an hour, their home burned to the ground, leaving behind only a smoldering pile of rubble.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fire was devastating for the family. Not only did it completely destroy their home and all their possessions (including irreplaceable photographs), it also jeopardized Natasha’s eligibility to continue as a foster parent to the two children, whom she has cared for the last seven years and loves as her own.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She said that day leading up to the fire was a bit hectic but relatively normal. She spent the day on a cleaning frenzy and prepped dinner before rounding the kids up for the trip into town.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was Natasha’s parents, Bob and Barb Wilson, and brother Tony Candelora who saw smoke rising from Natasha’s house. They live right next door in another house on the same property — a small farm where the family keeps a few horses and domestic pets.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bob and Tony rushed outside when they saw the smoke. Tony didn’t even put on shoes. Bob said they went inside the burning house to get the pets out.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The whole roof of the house, inside the house, was just swirling with smoke,” Bob said. “There was no flames or nothing, it was just smoke. Black smoke, just like curls on a woman’s hair … It was weird. It really was.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tony got the dog, Redford, a rust-coloured doberman, out safely. The cats took care of themselves. Bob and Tony got the rabbits out.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Then we turned around and looked back and the whole roof just come down,” Bob said, noting that when he and Tony opened the door to enter, air flowed up to the fire smoldering in the roof of the home. “Probably within less than 45 seconds the whole thing just come crashing down.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Barb dialed 9-1-1, momentarily forgetting that their property is outside the Thornhill Volunteer Fire Department’s coverage zone. The operator reiterated that fact and dispatched RCMP to assist.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rick Boehm, chief of the Thornhill fire department, told <em>The Terrace Standard </em>that it’s always tough for the fire department when they hear about a fire just outside their protection zone. The zone boundary is a federally-mandated 8-kilometre radius around the fire hall. Firefighters are only allowed to leave their protection boundary when someone’s life is in danger, such as a person trapped in a burning building, which wasn’t the case with this fire.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Barb said it wouldn’t have mattered anyway. From start to finish, the fire only lasted about 20 minutes, and she figures the fire department wouldn’t have been able to react in time.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boehm said that it does indeed take some time to get fire engines out to Old Remo.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The Old Remo location is sort of compound affected by the significant climb up that hill,” he said. “[Fire engines] can only go so quick on that little road and it is quite a slug to get those heavy, heavy trucks up that hill.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, the kids were at Taekwando and Natasha was relaxing at Cafenara with her boyfriend, Terry Healy, who had just arrived in Terrace that evening after a day of work in Prince Rupert. That’s when Natasha’s cell phone rang.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My mom’s yelling at me ‘Your house is on fire’ and I’m like ‘what?’” Natasha said. “You’re in shock when you hear that.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She rushed to gather the children from Taekwando while Terry jumped in his truck and drove like mad out to Old Remo. Even at breakneck speed, the roughly 14-kilometre drive from Terrace to the farm still leaves enough time for one’s mind to churn.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was wondering how far along the fire was. Can we save anything?” Terry said. “I didn’t think that the house was totally gone. I didn’t assume it would be that bad [but] as soon as I started down Queensway, and you look back this way, all you could see is a cloud of black smoke.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Natasha was just minutes behind with the children.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It looked like the whole forest was on fire,” she said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When she arrived, she noticed a collection of onlookers.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We had a lineup of people sitting in their cars, and I have to say, for me one of the most awful feelings is people sitting in their vehicle with their windows rolled up watching your house burn down,” Natasha said, tears welling in her eyes as she recalled the memory.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But there were also friendly neighbours who arrived to help. A pair of them comforted Natasha.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They’re holding me and I’m getting sick beside the car,” she said. “It’s overwhelming, the grief, the panic that goes through your mind.”</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-517\" data-attachment-id=\"517\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5600\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1604153925\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"18\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.016666666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"candelora-family\" data-large-file=\"https://jakewrayportfolio.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/candelora-family.jpg?w=660\" data-medium-file=\"https://jakewrayportfolio.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/candelora-family.jpg?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https://jakewrayportfolio.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/candelora-family.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3074,2183\" data-permalink=\"https://jakewrayportfolio.wordpress.com/candelora-family/\" height=\"494\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/jakewray-portfolio/media/journalism/foster-family-loses-home-to-fire/foster-family-loses-home-to-fire-2.jpg\" width=\"697\"/><figcaption>Natasha Candelora, centre, relaxes in her parents’ living room on Oct. 30, weeks after the fire, alongside her partner Terry Healy, left, and her father Bob Wilson, right. (Jake Wray/Terrace Standard)</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nearly four weeks after the fire, the smell of smoke still hangs in the air at the family farm. It’s Oct. 30 and the rubble has yet to be cleared. Redford, the doberman, has bandages on his front paws because he cut them mucking about in the debris.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The debris won’t be cleared until Natasha’s insurance processes the claim, and snow might fall before that, meaning cleanup may not happen until next year. Candelora says dealing with the insurance company has been straightforward (the company already supplied emergency funding for a hotel stay and items such as clothes) but the process inherently takes time. She is also waiting for the insurance company to complete an investigation of the fire and determine the cause — something the fire department would do, if Natasha’s home were within the fire protection district.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The family sits in the living room of Bob and Barb’s home. Natasha is still under a lot of stress trying to sort out new living arrangements and replace essential items, and the whole family is worn out from the ordeal. But they haven’t lost their senses of humour. They all laugh as Barb describes how Natasha’s cats moved themselves, with an air of entitlement, into Bob and Barb’s home.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The children, who are both around 12 years old, are coping fairly well, all things considered. The brother and sister are not identified in this story because provincial policy prevents foster children from being identified in the media. Initially, the girl was scared to go back to school because she was afraid of what all the other kids would say, but when she did go back she found her peers to be caring and supportive. The boy has expressed some anger following the fire.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bob and Natasha also say they are frustrated, particularly with B.C.’s Ministry of Children and Family Development, which oversees the foster care program. Bob and Barb are also foster parents, currently caring for four children. Bob and Barb have been foster parents for 25 years and Natasha has been a foster parent for 19 years. They say the ministry has been insulting and unhelpful in the aftermath of the fire, despite the decades-long relationship between the family and the ministry.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Almost immediately after the fire, a ministry worker informed Natasha that she had 30 days to find a new place or the children could be taken from her because Natasha’s contract with the ministry states she must have her own dwelling with enough bedrooms for each of the children to have their own.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s tough some days, but it is equally rewarding or you wouldn’t do it. It’s not for everyone to be a foster parent, but it’s something we’ve chosen as a family to give back. We feel it’s our calling,” Natasha says. “And then I don’t have the home any more so now I’m told … ‘you have a month to find a suitable place to raise these children.’”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Candelora says the ministry’s lack of flexibility on the timeline is unreasonable because rental properties are scarce in the Terrace area and the ministry offered no help in locating a rental or financial assistance with rent despite the fact that rent prices are much higher than her monthly mortgage payment. She says the ministry should have contingency funding to support foster families in crises.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You would think that there would be maybe something set aside by the government for emergency,” she says. “Don’t tell me that there isn’t some funding.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She says the notion that her children could be taken from her adds unnecessary pressure to an already stressful situation.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So these kids that know no one but me as their mother would have to go live with someone [else],” Natasha says through tears. “If they’re not with me they’ve been with my parents. They don’t know anyone but us. And they’re going to have to suffer and be punished for something out of all of our control? Because it’s not [ministry] policy?”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we try to resolve situations in the ministry, we always get ‘well, it’s our policy,’” Bob says. “Even though the policy doesn’t make any common sense, even if you couldn’t live by that policy, we are expected to live by that policy.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ministry offered only limited financial support to replace the children’s belongings like jackets and boots, Bob says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It was very insulting for [ministry workers] to come out here two days after the fire with a dozen donuts and four cups of coffee and $200 for one child and $200 for another child to replace everything that [the children] owned,” Bob says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The family says they could face consequences for speaking out against the ministry, which has a culture of silence, but they are fed up with the mistreatment.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Because of what I have said … I could [metaphorically] have a knife to my throat tomorrow,” Bob says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s their own little secret society,” Natasha says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s sad. And that’s why in our community we have very few foster parents. And very few relief workers,” Bob says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A manager of the local ministry office refused a request for comment and would not provide a reason why.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Angus Noble, a public affairs officer who works for the ministry at the provincial level, said foster parents are required to have their own home insurance that covers emergencies like fires or floods.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In addition, [the ministry] supports the availability of ‘Extended Property Damage (Rider) Insurance’ to supplement a residential caregiver’s homeowner or tenant insurance policy,” Noble said in an email statement. “This mirrors a foster parent’s basic coverage where damage is caused by a child or youth in care.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Noble said that when a foster parent suddenly loses access to housing, the ministry will work the parent to find a suitable alternative. He said that if the foster parent’s insurance didn’t cover the cost of alternative housing, the ministry may be able to pay for temporary support such as a hotel stay.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">— ~ —</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Nov. 5, Natasha said she had finally secured a rental for her and the children. That was a great relief, she said, though many challenges for the family still lie ahead, such as ironing out insurance details, managing the tricky financial situation, and creating a sense of normalcy for the children.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She’s deeply grateful to the Terrace area community who helped her family by donating money and clothing, particularly for the children.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They’ve got a decent pair of winter boots on their feet,” she said. “Without the community’s help, honestly I would have been screwed.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Natasha said relying on the community and her family for help can be uncomfortable at times, because she was so proud to have lived as an independent woman raising her children before the fire. Nevertheless, she appreciates the help.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.terracestandard.com/news/foster-family-loses-old-remo-home-to-fire/\">The Terrace Standard.</a></p>\n </div>",

(Mike Dangeli/Instagram)</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Oct. 30, 2020</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By Jake Wray</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mike Dangeli is a Tsimshian, Nisga’a and Tlingit artist and community leader.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He recently carved a memorial totem pole for missing and murdered Indigenous women, and he lead the raising ceremony for the totem pole on Kitsumkalum territory on Sept. 4.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 47-year-old father of three lives in Terrace with his wife Mique’l and their son Hayetsk, who is nearly a year old. Dangeli has two older sons, Nick and Michael, who are in their twenties.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dangeli has been immersed in Northwest Indigenous culture and making art since he was a boy, but he walked a long path before becoming an established, full-time artist.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He was born in the tiny village of Stella, Missouri, near an army base where his biological father was stationed. His family only stayed a few months there — they moved often due to military obligations. When his parents separated, Dangeli moved with his mom to California, Washington State and finally, southern Alaska.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Growing up, he spent time in southern Alaska and northern B.C., having family roots on both sides of the border.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the summers, he spent countless hours on a boat fishing with his Nisga’a grandfather, who instructed him in Nisga’a <em>adaawk</em> (oral history) and <em>ayuuk</em> (laws and protocol). He also learned from his grandmother, who was a gifted artist.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Not only did she do beading and weaving and leather work, but she also was a landscape painter as well as a portrait painter,” he said. “Her and my mom were my first art teachers.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Relatives also instructed him in the Tsimshian and Tlingit cultures. On the Tlingit side, he learned to make drums, which he traded for regalia, knowledge or tools.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a teenager, Dangeli played varsity football in Alaska and continued his cultural education on both sides of the border.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When he was 17, he enlisted with the United States Army (to his mother’s dismay), inspired by a long family history of military service. Many of his uncles served in Vietnam and Korea, including his uncle Bill, a marine who fought in the Fall of Saigon in 1975. Both of Dangeli’s grandfathers fought in the Second World War. A great-grandfather on his mother’s side was a member of the Alaska Territorial Guard.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dangeli served 10 years and did four tours of combat. He served in the Army Airborne, the Army Air Assault, and the Army Rangers. Those tours were through the UN’s involvement in the Somali Civil War, during the First Gulf War and at several other locations he cannot discuss.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Confidentiality agreements prevent him from publicly speaking about much of his time in the military, but he left with an honourable discharge.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dangeli has grown critical of his time in the military.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I tell my sons, I’ve been shot and stabbed and chewed enough dirt on foreign soil and fought enough that they don’t have to,” he said. “I look at where I was deployed and who sent me there, and it’s always rich politicians who are sending poor people off to war. I think that’s the way it’s been since the beginning of time. But I just don’t agree with the politics of where they’re sending us as soldiers, and I don’t think we’re really fighting for freedom and everything like we’re being told we are.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I still support our troops, because it’s not their choice. They’re not wanting to go do this. They’re just following orders.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Being in the military meant missing out on some of his oldest son’s early years, something Dangeli regretted.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I had him so young and then of course being deployed or away so many times, I felt like I missed a lot. And as a father, you know, that’s a pop in the chops,” he said. “I was able to reconnect and having some amazing time with him as a young pre-teen and teenager and all the way up into his adulthood.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Returning to civilian life was a difficult transition for Dangeli, as it is for so many soldiers. He carried a lot of pain home, but culture and tradition kept him grounded.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">”Knowing who I am, as far as being a Nisga’a/Tlingit/Tsimshian man, and practising my people’s traditions from an early age, being immersed in them … I really feel like helped me survive all of that,” he said. “Even when I came home with lots of baggage, and was angry about some of the things I had to do in combat. The culture and the art saved my life.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dangeli used the American GI Bill to go back to school in Alaska. He worked as a fisherman and in tourism. He transferred to school in Washington State where, for a time, he was intent on becoming a history teacher. He did an intensive carving apprenticeship under David Boxley, a Tsimshian artist from Metlakatla, Alaska.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then he went through a difficult divorce. Hurting from that, and still bearing some pain from his years of service, Dangeli planned to return to the Nass Valley to lick his wounds. But first he stopped off in Vancouver, where he needed to earn a little cash.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He was asked to complete a totem pole that had been abandoned halfway through the carving process. The original carvers, who seemed to struggle with addiction issues, took an initial payment for work on the pole and then disappeared. Subsequently, the totem pole was stolen twice, ending up on Vancouver Island at one point. It was beaten with a baseball bat. Somebody spray painted a racist name for Indigenous people on it.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dangeli related to the beat-up pole.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It just was abused, so I saw it as a physical manifestation of where I was at,” he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He ended up getting a grant to have 12 youth work with him on the totem pole project. He taught them how to hold a traditional pole-raising potlatch, how to make gifts for the potlatch, and other protocols.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As many as 500 kids from the Vancouver area came by to help work on the totem pole itself.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It ended up being this really beautiful moment,” Dangeli said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After that, the friendship centre where he had been carving invited him to stay a while, to hold some workshops and things of that nature. He ended up living in the Lower Mainland for 20 years.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He met his wife, Mique’l, when they both apprenticed under the same master carver.

The resulting lava flow is believed to have killed approximately 2,000 Nisga’a people, destroying three villages in the Nass Valley. This scientific understanding is corroborated by Nisga’a oral history. Now the vast fields of lava rock are preserved as a provincial park, jointly managed by the Nisga’a Lisims government and the B.C. government.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The volcano has been researched before, but until now there had never been extensive mapping of the volcano cone or the beds of lava rock that were formed when lava flowed 32 km into the valley, nor had a precise timeline of events been established.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In summer 2016, researchers from SFU, UBC, and Quest University in Squamish began fieldwork in the lava beds, returning again in the summers of 2017 and 2019. They studied the surface of the lava beds, measured the depth of the lava beds at various points, and measured the depth of Lava Lake and Melita Lake, to determine how much lava had flowed into those waters. The researchers also obtained aerial photos of the volcano cone and lava beds. The data was then punched into 3D modelling software for further insight.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The research culminated in a paper called “<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17445647.2020.1758809\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Physical</a><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17445647.2020.1758809\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> volcanology of Tseax </a><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17445647.2020.1758809\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Volcano,</a>” which was published online May 12. Lead author of the paper Yannick Le Moigne is a PhD candidate at SFU and the paper is his PhD thesis.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Le Moigne told <em>The Terrace Standard </em>that the biggest surprise from the research was just how much lava flowed from the relatively small volcano.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The volcano is very, very small compared to the lava flow,” he said, comparing the size of the lava flow to the size of the Skeena River today. “[It was] an enormous volume of lava flow, very hot … flowing like a river in the valleys, reaching the [Nisga’a] villages in a day or two, destroying everything in its path.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many of the Nisga’a people were killed by a poisonous gas, not the lava itself, according to Nisga’a oral history that was recorded in the Canadian Geographical Journal in 1935. Le Moigne said that is likely true, but he and other researchers can only speculate about gasses related to the eruption.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They were not necessarily killed by the lava flow, but maybe once the lava flow arrived, was in contact with the Nass River, there would have been some gas emissions,” he said. “When you have … a very hot lava flow, in contact with the cold water like the Nass River, you have a lot of emissions of vapor of water, but also any volcanic gasses like CO2, sulphuric gasses, etc., and if you smell those gasses you could be in trouble.”</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-487\" data-attachment-id=\"487\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"200611-tst-tseax-volcano-2\" data-large-file=\"https://jakewrayportfolio.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/200611-tst-tseax-volcano-2.jpeg?w=660\" data-medium-file=\"https://jakewrayportfolio.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/200611-tst-tseax-volcano-2.jpeg?w=246\" data-orig-file=\"https://jakewrayportfolio.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/200611-tst-tseax-volcano-2.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"1500,1831\" data-permalink=\"https://jakewrayportfolio.wordpress.com/200611-tst-tseax-volcano-2/\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/jakewray-portfolio/media/journalism/scientists-produce-extensive-map-of-tseax-volcano-lava-flow/scientists-produce-extensive-map-of-tseax-volcano-lava-flow-2.jpeg\" width=\"839\"/></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Tseax Volcano is unlikely to erupt again, Le Moigne said. It was formed as the result of rifting, where two tectonic places pull apart, thinning the Earth’s crust and allowing magma to spill out from the Earth’s mantle. This process typically results in volcanos that only erupt once, which is true for most volcanos in northern B.C. and Alaska.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“All these volcanos, like 90 per cent of them, are monogenetic volcanos, because they only erupted one time, and then [they stop],” Le Moigne said. “So, at the moment, we are thinking that Tseax is also a monogenetic volcano … But we are not 100 per cent sure, maybe in the future there will be another eruption.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Le Moigne, who is from France, said he chose to come work on the Tseax Volcano for his PhD because the volcano had barely been studied.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It was an opportunity to study everything, from the basic, to the more complex history of the volcano,” he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nisga’a people provided great assistance to the research, Le Moigne said, a contribution not available in most earth science studies.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They gave us a lot of data from their oral histories, and that helped us a lot when we wrote, step by step, what happened at Tseax,” he said. “This is a very cool project to merge the two aspects of the world. You have the [earth] science, and then you have the … social science from the Nisga’a.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.terracestandard.com/news/scientists-produce-extensive-map-of-tseax-volcano-lava-flow/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Terrace Standard.</a></p>\n </div>",

The referendum required over 50 per cent of PC Alberta votes and 75 per cent of Wildrose Party votes in order to pass. 95 per cent of the ballots from each party were cast in favour of unity.</p>\n<p>The new conglomerate party, called the United Conservative Party (UCP), is now the official opposition in Alberta’s legislature. The UCP selected Nathan Cooper, who came into the UCP as a Wildrose Party MLA, to serve as its interim leader until the actual leadership vote on Oct. 28.</p>\n<p>Jim Lightbody, a political scientist at the University of Alberta, said there is still plenty of work to be done in merging the two parties.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of mechanical stuff. Integrating constitutions, figuring out how to deal with financial rules,” he said. “You’ve got two quite autonomous organizations here. Even though they’ve voted to unite, each thinks they’re better than the other. There’s going to be a lot of personalities that have to be dealt with, so it’s a long path to get to the unified party.”</p>\n<p>The core principles of the UCP won’t be finalized until a leader is elected in October, according to Lightbody. He said PC Alberta leader Jason Kenney and Wildrose Party leader Brian Jean are likely to be the frontrunners in that leadership race.</p>\n<p>“Because of their experience being leaders and because of the fact that they will have had close working relations with many of the people who will form the party executive and the two caucuses in the legislature, whether that will present an insurmountable barrier, I think it will, to someone from outside coming in, remains to be seen,” Lightbody said. “There’s no one in the legislature who has sufficient standing to be taken seriously (as a leadership candidate) in comparison to Kenney and Jean.”</p>\n<p>Gord Molnar, a Wildrose Party member (and now UCP member) from Stony Plain, said he will keep an open mind throughout the leadership race.</p>\n<p>“I will be open moving forward, with how each of the candidates present themselves, because I don’t know all the candidates very well, but I do know Brian Jean. If I had to vote today, I’d vote for Brian Jean,” Molnar said. “He doesn’t really (strike) me as being one of the old boys’ club. He seems to be a little bit of, I guess, a revolutionary. He’s got some very strong credentials. He’s a lawyer by trade, but he’s also a trapper, so when you look at blue-collar/white-collar, he fits the mould of probably (the majority) of the populace.”</p>\n<p>Molnar said he voted in favour of unification. His biggest concern moving forward, he said, is that core Wildrose Party values could get put aside in the merger.</p>\n<p>“The only fear that I have is maybe losing some of those grassroots principles, where everyone has a voice. Like, even the MLAs I think within the Wildrose, they’re allowed a free vote. They’re allowed to vote on conscience. They don’t necessarily have to toe the party line,” he said. “Those are things that are really held strong in my view, is the fact that you can be free in the Wildrose. You can speak what you want to speak and you can do what you want to do without recourse.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Article originally appeared in <a href=\"http://www.sprucegroveexaminer.com/2017/07/27/conservative-parties-merge-after-referendum\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Spruce Grove Examiner</a></p>\n </div>",

Homeowners beyond the range have complained of stray bullets. – Photo by Jake Wray Reporter/Examiner</figcaption></figure>\n<p>July 20, 2017</p>\n<p>By Jake Wray</p>\n<p>The Spruce Grove Gun Club (SGGC) has begun a defamation lawsuit, by filing a statement of claim, against Parkland County Mayor Rod Shaigec.</p>\n<p>The statement of claim, which was filed on July 13 at the Court of Queen’s Bench in Edmonton, is centred on comments Shaigec allegedly made about another lawsuit against the SGGC. Darren and Natasha Degeer, who owned a home downrange from the SGGC, sued the gun club in 2014 after finding a bullet lodged in the wall of their house. The Degeers eventually dropped their case against the SGGC and it was never legally established that the bullet lodged in their house came from the SGGC.</p>\n<p>According to Bill Newton, a spokesperson for the SGGC, the new defamation suit is in response to an email the SGGC says that Shaigec sent to a county resident implying that the bullet that hit the Degeers’ house had in fact come from the SGGC.</p>\n<p>“(Shaigec wrote that) the bullet that hit the Degeer’s home was fired from a semi-automatic firearm and that semi-automatic firearms can only be fired on a range like (the SGGC’s range,) legally,” Newton said. “His comment that semi-automatic firearms can only be used on a range — that’s completely inaccurate. Guys can hunt deer with semi-automatic rifles, and do, so why (Mayor Shaigec) would say that, I don’t know, but it certainly is, in our mind, defamatory.”</p>\n<p>Shaigec did not respond to interview requests by press deadline.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit was filed just days after Parkland County council took the first steps toward enacting a bylaw amendment that would jeopardize the SGGC. On July 11 council voted 5-2 in favour of the first reading of a Land Use Bylaw amendment that would prohibit outdoor shooting ranges in land zoned as country residential. The property where SGGC has operated since the early seventies is currently zoned as country residential.</p>\n<p>At the Parkland County council meeting on July 11, nearly 20 members of the public made statements to council about the bylaw amendment, including Greg Zederayko, a member of the SGGC who asked Shaigec to “recuse himself” from voting on the amendment.</p>\n<p>“I believe, as do many others, that the mayor has demonstrated a longstanding bias toward the SGGC, (and) has already made up his mind that the council should amend the bylaw as presented,” Zederayko said. “It’s alleged that in 2013 the mayor told them and other residents that the County would not renew the (SGGC’s) development permit once it expired in June 2014. As we know, the mayor and council are not entitled to input as to whether or not a development permit should be renewed.”</p>\n<p>Shaigec responded immediately to Zederayko’s accusations.</p>\n<p>“I will not recuse myself. I have demonstrated in my seven years of public service that I consider the facts from all parties when deliberating any matter that comes before council, and I will do so with this particular issue that’s before council for debate and discussion. I will do so without prejudice,” Shaigec said. “I can state unequivocally, for the record, that I did not make, nor did any council member, make any statement to any member of the public or the (SGGC) that I would direct, or any council member would ensure, that a development permit would not be issued.”</p>\n<p>Shaigec has until Aug. 2 to file a statement of defence, or a demand for notice, in response or he risks automatically losing the lawsuit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.sprucegroveexaminer.com/2017/07/20/gun-club-sues-parkland-county-mayor/wcm/4c816862-c6c1-4d5b-0834-58f6ece8da1e\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Spruce Grove Examiner</a></p>\n </div>",

Photo by Roberto Teixeira</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Dec. 2, 2016</p>\n<p>By Chahira Merarsi and Jake Wray</p>\n<p>Bullying council members into silence, staff resisting changes by elected members, and booze on the students’ dime are just a few of the accusations being levelled against the Langara Students’ Union by sources who talked exclusively to <em>The Voice.</em></p>\n<p>The allegations come on the heels of the abrupt firing of the LSU’s general manager Desmond Rodenbour, who claims he was hired to implement reform. At the same meeting, the LSU also fired its legal counsel, which had recommended Rodenbour, and an elected board member.</p>\n<p>Harsimran Malhi, who was elected in this year’s spring election, said she was fired last week after spending months trying to enact reform in the student union.</p>\n<h4>Staff allegedly threatened board members</h4>\n<p>Malhi said the LSU staff threatened to take legal action if she kept trying to improve transparency and modernize the union.</p>\n<p>“We were threatened a few times,” she said. “It was like we were told ‘you’ll face grievances because this is not something that is our job.’”</p>\n<p>Officially, she was fired for missing two board meetings. She said she had alerted the GM that she would miss the meetings for personal issues that had come up.</p>\n<p>Malhi said she felt like some staff were unsupportive.</p>\n<p>“We saw threats were given to us because we were trying to ask for policies because if you don’t know what the policies say, how can you do something?” She added that as a council member, they would be “accused of things again and again.”</p>\n<p>Malhi said it was made very clear to her when she was elected, that asking questions was not seen favourably by the staff.</p>\n<p>Malhi said staff also balked when council members discussed hiring legal counsel.</p>\n<p>“They basically walked out of the meeting,” she told <em>The Voice</em>. “We wanted everyone to be on board. But the reaction that we got was really unexpected.”</p>\n<h4>Allegations of financial impropriety</h4>\n<p>Emma Leigha Munro, a former LSU member-at-large, said she witnesssed questionable financial decisions, although Malhi claims she never witnessed any evidence of that.</p>\n<p>“There were definitely things that were questionable,” Munro said Thursday. “Such as alcoholic beverages at a party, open tabs, board parties, Christmas parties.”</p>\n<p>Munro told <em>The Voice</em> that she was suspicious of LSU spending and her feeling was that staff wielded the real power in the LSU while elected members were treated as pawns.</p>\n<p>“I feel like they ran the whole thing and we were just there because they needed it to look like we were there,” Munro said.</p>\n<p>Another source familiar with the LSU said he was unimpressed with the way things were run and staff often pressured council members to do their bidding.</p>\n<p>The source expressed concern about the number of people pushed out over the last 16 months.</p>\n<p>“It’s essentially like putting Langara back into the dark ages,” he said.</p>\n<p><em>The Voice</em> reached out for comment from the LSU, which did not respond.</p>\n<p>Another issue raised was how staff tried to prevent elected board members from connecting with other student societies, including the umbrella Alliance of B.C. Students.</p>\n<p>In an April 2016 email obtained by <em>The Voice</em>, LSU staff member Gurbax Lealh instructed ABCS officials to always contact LSU staff before approaching elected LSU council members.</p>\n<p><em>The Voice</em>, Thursday, attempted to contact the LSU for comment and got no response.</p>\n<p>Langara College officials also declined to comment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Article originally appeared in <em><a href=\"http://www.langaravoice.ca/2016/12/02/lsu-accused-of-misconduct/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Langara Voice</a></em></p>\n </div>",
