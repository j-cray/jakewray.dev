    "content_html": "<p>Six million dollars are once again on the line for Terrace and Kitselas First Nation.</p>\n<p>Taisheng International Investment Services, the former developer of the Skeena Industrial Development Park (SIDP), is appealing a court decision from October 2025 that saw a joint venture between the City of Terrace and Kitselas First Nation keep a $6 million construction deposit from Taisheng after the developer did not build a groundwater system at the SIDP.</p>\n<p>Court documents obtained by <em>The Terrace Standard</em> show that an appeal was filed in November 2025 but do not list an argument for the appeal. Representatives of Taisheng Internatioal Investment Services did not respond to request for comment by press deadline.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>A spokesperson for the City of Terrace confirmed the City is still in litigation for the $6 million, and said that the City is currently lobbying higher levels of government for money to get the groundwater system built at the SIDP.</p>\n<p>\u201cBased on Taisheng incomplete drawings it is believed very rough (no quotes involved yet) $32 million dollar cost to get water in the park,\u201d the spokesperson said in an email. \u201cHence, we are in the process of lobbying the government for a package of money that won\u2019t set Terrace back even further.\u201d</p>\n<p>The decision in October dismissed a lawsuit from Taisheng International Investment Services seeking to recover the $6 million deposit. The judge, Justice Underhill, stated that Taisheng was not entitled to the return of the deposit after it failed to meet contractual deadlines, which ultimately led the City of Terrace to repurchase the lands.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo find otherwise,\u201d the justice wrote, \u201cwould result in Taisheng receiving a $6.18 million windfall.\u201d</p>\n<p>The case originates from a 2014 agreement where Taisheng agreed to purchase 1,187 acres of land from the city for $11.878 million. The contract required Taisheng to develop the lands into an industrial park, which included constructing a road and a groundwater system.</p>\n<p>Under the agreement, Taisheng was eligible for reimbursements for this infrastructure work if it met specific deadlines. The city agreed to reimburse Taisheng approximately $6.18 million for the construction of the groundwater system.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>By 2019, with the system still not built, the parties executed an amendment to their contract. In a transaction that occurred on June 28, 2019, the City of Terrace paid Taisheng the $6,183,686.80 \u201cgroundwater reimbursement.\u201d On the same day, Taisheng paid the exact same amount back to the city, where it was held as a \u201cconstruction deposit\u201d to be used as security for the completion of the water system.</p>\n<p>According to the court decision, Taisheng failed to meet the construction milestones set out in the development plan. As a result, the City of Terrace exercised its option to purchase the land back on Oct. 15, 2021, a move that was validated in a separate arbitration proceeding. The lands were officially transferred back to the city on Oct. 4, 2023.</p>\n<p>A day later, Taisheng demanded the return of its $6.18 million deposit, arguing that since the city now owned the land, it could not use the deposit for its intended purpose. In a joint statement, the City of Terrace and Kitselas First Nation confirmed the \u201cconstruction deposit will be retained by the Joint Venture to be used on the park\u2019s groundwater system,\u201d which is now estimated to cost over $14 million.</p>\n<p>Taisheng argued that the contract\u2019s terms meant the deposit could only be used for work \u201cattributable to the purchaser\u201d (Taisheng) and that the city exercising its buy-back option made this impossible. Justice Underhill rejected this interpretation, calling it \u201ccommercially absurd.\u201d He found the contract\u2019s language was \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d that the money was security.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe intention of the parties, reflected in the language of the purchase agreement, is clear,\u201d the decision said. \u201cThe purpose of the transaction was to see the SIDP developed, and it was expressly structured to secure Taisheng\u2019s commitments to proceed with that development in a timely manner, failing which Terrace could repurchase the lands.\u201d</p>\n<p>The judge also dismissed Taisheng\u2019s alternative argument that keeping the deposit amounted to an \u201cunenforceable penalty.\u201d He ruled the deposit was not \u201cunconscionable\u201d or \u201cpenal,\u201d especially given the high cost of the water system.</p>\n<p><em>\u2014With files from Rod Link</em></p>",

Of those surveyed this year, 74 were sheltered while 57 were unsheltered.</p>\n<p>Indigenous people continue to be overrepresented among Terrace\u2019s homeless population. Sixty-one per cent of respondents identified as Indigenous, compared to about 22 per cent of Terrace\u2019s overall population. The report notes that systemic racism, intergenerational trauma, and barriers to accessing services contribute to these disproportionate rates.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>The survey found that 81 per cent of respondents reported being homeless for more than a year, and two-thirds had been without housing for five years or longer. Nearly half said they first experienced homelessness as youth, and 52 per cent had been in foster care or a group home. Respondents reported high rates of health issues, including mental illness, substance use challenges, physical disabilities, and acquired brain injuries. Many faced overlapping conditions.</p>\n<p>Substance use was very common. The most frequently reported substances were nicotine, alcohol, stimulants, cannabis and opiates. The leading reasons for losing housing included not enough income, conflict with a spouse or partner, abuse, and substance use. Nine per cent said their most recent housing loss was due to an eviction.</p>\n<p>Income insecurity was another defining factor. The majority of those surveyed relied on social assistance income or disability assistance, and just eight per cent reported regular employment.</p>\n<p>The report stresses that Point-in-Time counts represent a minimum estimate, as they only measure a single 24-hour period. By focusing on a single day, a count will not include some people who cycle in and out of homelessness, and the methodology almost certainly under-counts the true extent of homelessness in Terrace.</p>\n<p>This was the second provincial homeless count held in Terrace, following the first in 2023. Local coordination for the 2025 survey was led by the \u2018Ksan Society with support from community volunteers and people with lived experience of homelessness.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div>",

Not present were Inderpal Dhillon of the Liberal Party and Adeana Young of the Green Party.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Candidates were asked about their party's approach to healthcare, a question many in the audience were concerned about due to frequent emergency department closures at\u00a0the Lakes District Hospital and Health Centre, as well as a shortage of general practitioners in the area.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Taylor said his party would prevent medical procedures that his party considers unnecessary.</p>\n<p>\"We're using government health care dollars on things that are not healthcare either, the surgery to try to turn a boy into a girl, that's not healthcare. That's cosmetic surgery, that money should be going to pay for hearts and hips and things that Canadians need,\" he said.\u00a0\"We're paying for abortion killing 100,000 babies every year.\"</p>\n<p>Bachrach said that healthcare policy falls under provincial jurisdiction but his party would take measures to support the provinces such as increasing transfer payments. He added that he was inspired\u00a0recently by an alternative approach to recruiting family doctors in Fort St. James.</p>\n<p>\"At one point, Fort, St James was down to a single doctor, and he was about to retire, and they knew something had to be done, and they decided to really reinvent the wheel. They created a primary care society, a non profit society that would employ the doctors,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"Instead of doctors\u00a0working on block time, where they get a certain amount of money for every five minute appointment, they would pay them a salary. They give them a good work life balance, and they support them properly with administrative support. And they got up to the point where I think they had eight doctors.\"</p>\n<p>Ross said that doctors and nurses are being put into dangerous situations when they are asked to treat people with serious addictions issues,</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\"Alberta's got a great model. They took addictions out of the healthcare program, and they've set up treatment centres\u00a0all over Alberta, and it's fully funded,\" he said. \"Pierre Poilievre\u00a0has said that he'll treat 50,000 of those people suffering addictions.\"</p>\n<p>The candidates discussed a wide range of other issues including Indigenous policy, national debt and toxic drugs. Candidates were\u00a0asked if their party has a plan to combat climate change.</p>\n<p>Ross said his party opposes measures like the carbon tax that punish Canadians.</p>\n<p>\"We are not the biggest group in the world. We don't even criticize China, Russia, United States. We punish Canadians\u00a0with a carbon tax,\" he said, adding that the House of Commons has yet to sit and remove carbon tax legislation. \"Do you think the carbon tax is taken away? Wrong. It's separate. You can't take it away until the House sits and you get rid of legislation.\"</p>\n<p>Taylor said his party does not believe in man-made climate change.</p>\n<p>\"The Christian Heritage Party takes a position that carbon dioxide is not pollution. Carbon dioxide is plant food. It's a part of our natural atmosphere, component, component that plants need. The more they have, the better they grow,\" he said. \"The whole theory is an unproven theory. There are thousands of scientists who do not follow the theory of man caused climate change due to carbon dioxide.\"</p>\n<p>Bachrach said his party intends to meet Canada's existing international commitments regarding greenhouse gas reduction under the Paris Accord.</p>\n<p>\"Canada's target under international law is 40 to 45% reduction based on 2000 2005 levels by 2030 so that's what we've committed to to our international peers, and our party believes that Canada should fulfill that commitment,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

We\u2019re doing our best but it does start to weigh on the staff.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cWe are running on fumes for way too many of our shifts.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hospital staff feel frustrated as many of the COVID-19 patients they are treating seem to have not followed public health protocols, Dr. McCoach said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cA lot of the cases are from people not doing their part at the societal level and they\u2019re still partying, they\u2019re still socializing, they\u2019re still not taking the pandemic seriously in the way it needs to be, and unfortunately [hospital staff] are suffering because of that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really does threaten the stability of our health care system if COVID is allowed to run unchecked. I think people need to get that message a little bit clearer.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt\u2019s not a hoax. It\u2019s not influenza. It\u2019s not just a flu season that will go away. It is something that needs to be taken seriously, and really the fate of our medical system remains in the public\u2019s hands.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Dr. McCoach acknowledged the difficulties that come with pandemic safety measures.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cWe know people are tired. It\u2019s not an easy thing to ask,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are real harms from changing the way we socialize and interact but, fundamentally, this remains in [the public\u2019s] hands.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There have been COVID-19-related deaths at Mills Memorial Hospital, Dr. McCoach said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cWhen you see people that got sick sometimes having done the right thing, doing their best to stay at home, doing their best to isolate \u2026 Seeing people like that get sick, that is very demoralizing,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dr. McCoach said fewer than 20 hospital staff have received vaccines so far, but its arrival still provides some hope on the horizon for staff.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked what the public can do to help the situation and support front-line staff, beyond adhering to public health protocols, Dr. McCoach said simple gestures of gratitude would be immensely helpful.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThere is a very large team of people as well that are putting in a lot of extra hours, from pharmacy staff, physio staff, occupational therapy, the public health teams \u2026 the housekeeping staff who have gone above and beyond the call of duty,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you know somebody, send a little message just to say thank you. It is very, very difficult and demoralizing right now, and we need the extra thank-yous.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cEspecially the nurses \u2014 they have moved mountains to make sure the community remains safe.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.thenorthernview.com/news/its-not-a-hoax-terrace-hospital-busier-than-ever-with-covid-19-cases-5978773\">The Terrace Standard.</a></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n </div>",

He overcame struggles with drugs, alcohol and the hard life in his youth and now aims to be a positive influence.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One means of achieving that is through his art. Sampare is obsessed with hip-hop, having produced 15 mixtapes and two albums under his solo moniker, and he hosts a free hip-hop podcast called the Smoke House Radio which he produces from his home in Laxgalts\u2019ap (Greenville) in the Nass Valley.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cWhen I started pointing out the bad \u2026 the really obvious horrible [stuff] that\u2019s in our community, people started listening to my music,\u201d he said. \u201cLike if I said \u2018if you\u2019re selling hard drugs in my community, don\u2019t be surprised if I point you out.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI don\u2019t want no one ever poisoning my fellow man in our community because I lived that life when I was younger.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Sampare was eight years old, his father passed away and he went to live with his grandparents. In his later teenage years, he became mixed up with drugs and alcohol.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI lived in Terrace. I lived in the \u2018hood. I was a mean person back then,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But that life quickly grew stale. Fourteen years ago he quit hard drugs and he\u2019s been sober from alcohol for 10 years.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI have a lot of youth that are in my family. I\u2019ve seen them get scared of other people that are intoxicated, and I did not want that to be me,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be known as a drunk or a drug-dealer or just this gangster-ass person to the community.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt\u2019s just the rut that Indigenous [people] get caught up in or stereotyped as, and I don\u2019t want that. Ever. I wish the best for everyone, always.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sampare first became obsessed with hip-hop when he heard his cousin freestyling years ago.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cHe was smoking some weed and drinking at a party and he was freestyling, and I was like \u2018what the hell?!\u2019\u201d Sampare said. \u201cI watched him and my [other] cousin, because they were like a duo, I watched them dual like Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, they\u2019d feed off each other\u2019s energy, rap bar for bar, and I was just amazed with it.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cAfter that, I just started studying everything.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He made his cousin teach him how to write verses and choruses. With no formal training in music or audio production, he bought a microphone and a Macbook and just started making music. The early stuff is \u201ccrap,\u201d Sampare said with a laugh, but eventually he started to get the hang of it.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He spent some time as a member of a local hip-hop group called North Side Connect Gang (NSCG). The group had been trying, without success, to get airplay on radio stations like CBC Radio and CFNR, so they started podcasting for exposure.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cWe were trying to get on radio stations but we couldn\u2019t so we just started the podcast to network with other artists throughout Canada, and it just sort of blew up,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eventually, Sampare had a falling out with other members of the band, so he rebranded and went his own direction. That\u2019s when The Smoke House Radio was born. The podcast is a mix of hip-hop music, some news and random information from throughout the internet, cannabis culture and video game culture.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The name of the podcast is certainly a reference to cannabis culture, but Sampare said the name came to him when he was in a literal smoke house.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI was in the smoke house with a load of fish, I think there was like 90 fish up over my head, and I was like \u2018where there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire. You smoke your food \u2026 Everything relates around the smoke house.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Smoke House Radio averages between 2,000 and 4,000 plays per episode, with listeners around the world. Only 14 per cent of listeners are from Canada, while 33 per cent of listeners are in the United States and 15 per cent are from Germany. Sampare figures he has about 900 listeners in the Nass Valley and about 90 in Terrace.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The podcast is entirely free and Sampare said it will always stay that way.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cOnce I start charging money for it, it\u2019s just going to be haywire,\u201d he said, noting he\u2019s wary of the pitfalls that come with having an audience. \u201cI don\u2019t want to break relationships or step on people while my show is getting huge.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sampare said he\u2019s eager to grow the podcast audience and he has plans to start publishing more music (most of which hasn\u2019t been officially released) on platforms such as music streaming giant Spotify under the small label GetALifeRecords, which Sampare runs with his younger brother and frequent collaborator Eric Sampare, also known as Lyrical E.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prior to the pandemic, the brothers were booking shows in the Northwest with Dosed-Up Entertainment, an entertainment management company based in Houston, B.C. With live shows cancelled due to COVID-19, the pair are focused on writing and producing more tracks.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nevertheless, Sampare can\u2019t wait to perform again.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIf you can get a person to relate to your music and come to your shows and meet you, it is the greatest feeling in the world.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To listen to The Truth, head to\u00a0<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ronniesampare?utm_source=terrace%20standard&amp;utm_campaign=terrace%20standard%3A%20outbound&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">soundcloud.com/ronniesampare</a>\u00a0and to listen to the Smoke House Radio head to\u00a0<a href=\"https://anchor.fm/ronnie-sampare?utm_source=terrace%20standard&amp;utm_campaign=terrace%20standard%3A%20outbound&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">anchor.fm/ronnie-sampare/</a>\u00a0or look in your favourite podcast app.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.terracestandard.com/community/skeena-voices-everything-relates-around-the-smoke-house-6053288\">The Terrace Standard.</a></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n </div>",

Organizers said the rally was also to raise awareness for missing and murdered Indigenous women. Some demonstrators held signs bearing the name of Chantel Moore, a 26-year-old Indigenous woman from Vancouver Island who was shot and killed by police in New Brunswick on June 4 after moving there to be closer to her five-year-old daughter.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chants including \u201cno justice, no peace,\u201d and \u201cblack lives matter\u201d were punctuated by heavy gusts of wind, though it was clear and sunny. Plenty of demonstrators wore medical masks and some wore gloves. Many cars driving past on Eby St. honked, with some drivers and passengers giving thumbs-up to indicate support.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A handful of demonstrators took up a megaphone to share stories and messages with the crowd.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mina Lwal told the crowd she had faced racism at school in Kitimat.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThey referred to me as \u2018the ugly black girl.\u2019 \u2026 Every time I walked down the hall, I\u2019d hear them whispering, or behind my back in group chats they\u2019d talk about it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know what, I\u2019m owning it today. I\u2019m not an ugly black girl, I\u2019m for sure a beautiful South-Sudanese woman living in Canada today, in front of all of you.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lwal asked the crowd to be as loud as they possibly could for all the chants that day.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThis movement is not going anywhere, and we, as a people, are not going anywhere because we\u2019re strong,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are all one race, and that\u2019s the human race, and we all deserve to get treated as equal because at the end of the day, I bleed the same as you do, and I cry the same as you do.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amber Webb, who is black, shared with the crowd some words written by her father.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cA group of National Guard members went down on one knee in solidarity \u2026 This is what we need, rather than the hatred and violence spewing out of the White House which poisons the US, Canada, and the world,\u201d she said. \u201cOur government, cowering inside our houses of Parliament, lacking the courage to stand up to a bully or call a lie a lie, is not anything to admire.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Webb\u2019s father\u2019s words also touched upon economic inequality.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cAt the heart of all of this, our countries have become quasi-democracies, where the real power lies within the wealthiest ten per cent. If we do not serve them, they will hurt us,\u201d she said to the crowd. \u201cSurely we will look at the bullying power and luxurious life of the few, beside the poverty, suffering and powerlessness and ask \u2018can we allow this modern form of slavery to continue?\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There were some criticisms of the rally voiced in the comments of a post in the Terrace Community Bulletin Board on Facebook (though most comments were supportive.)</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI absolutely think there should be non-violent protests, but not for this. There is significantly more black-on-black crime and no one bats an eye. Where are your protests when that happens?\u201d wrote Brittany Joyce. \u201cWhat are you accomplishing?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One commenter raised safety concerns regarding the pandemic.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI hope folks are maintaining proper social distancing,\u201d wrote Warren Wilson.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the organizers of the event, Shea Kurisu, acknowledged the risk of gathering a crowd during this pandemic but said the rally was essential work. Organizers handed out free masks to demonstrators. Ultimately, Kurisu said, demonstrators were each responsible for their own safety.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kurisu said she organized the event because her husband and two children are people of colour.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI see the injustices that people of colour live with every single day, and I wanted to use my white privilege and my voice to raise the voices of those that aren\u2019t being heard,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jillian Kofoed, who organized the event alongside Kurisu, said she organized the event because she hasn\u2019t done enough to stand up to racism.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cSilence is compliance. I am not a racist, but I never said anything against racism,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to educate ourselves about all of it, we\u2019re not perfect, we\u2019ve still got a lot to learn. That\u2019s part of the reason why we\u2019re doing this today is because we needed to hear the voices of the people that this affects first-hand.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.terracestandard.com/news/anti-racism-demonstration-held-in-terrace/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Terrace Standard.</a></p>\n </div>",

(Facebook Photo)</figcaption></figure>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Persons of interest questioned, not enough evidence to pursue charges</h4>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dec. 10, 2020</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By Jake Wray</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The question \u2018what if?\u2019 has haunted Garrett Kerr for more than two years now.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His brother, Cameron Kerr, 30, was killed in a hit and run in the early hours of Nov. 18, 2018 while walking home after drinking. Cameron was a sheet metal worker by trade, but he was also a former player for the Terrace River Kings hockey team and an avid outdoorsman who loved paddling, hunting and fishing. Everyone knew he was kind and compassionate and he had a tremendous sense of humour, Garrett says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The driver of the vehicle has not been caught, despite a rigorous RCMP investigation that has turned up significant evidence and identified a group of suspects from the Lower Mainland who may have colluded to cover up the incident.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garrett and Cameron were together that night and when speaking to Garrett it\u2019s clear he has asked himself over and over what he could have done differently, as so many people do when they grieve such a loss \u2014 particularly when the investigation is incomplete, leaving the family with few answers.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The night Cameron was killed, the brothers had attended a wake for a friend who died young of an overdose. Friends and family had gathered for a bittersweet night of sharing memories, Garrett says, at a home in New Remo.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Cameron was ready to leave, he decided to walk home to Terrace along Hwy 16. It\u2019s a long walk, but not unfamiliar to the brothers, who grew up in New Remo. Before Cameron left, he had a conversation with Garrett in the driveway. Garrett tried to convince him to wait for a cab or to sleep at their parents\u2019 home in New Remo.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Cameron wanted to walk, so Garrett let him go and returned to the party.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An oncoming vehicle struck Cameron shortly after he left as he walked against traffic on the shoulder of the highway, according to the RCMP. The driver and companions took hours to cover up the incident before continuing northwest along the highway, the Kerr family says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A while after Cameron left, Garrett and a group of friends piled into a cab and headed toward Terrace. There was an energetic mood in the cab, Garrett says, and nobody was paying attention to the ditch on the opposite side of the road.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI still don\u2019t know to this day whether my brother was alive when I rode by in the cab,\u201d Garrett says, his voice breaking, in a recent interview with <em>The Terrace Standard</em>. \u201cThe longer these guys hold out and don\u2019t co-operate, the longer I have to live with that.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cameron\u2019s body was found in the ditch around noon by a member of the public.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garrett had been trying to reach Cameron that morning and had gone by Cameron\u2019s place to find he wasn\u2019t home. Then Garrett drove back out toward New Remo with a sinking feeling in his gut.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI had made most of the drive out there wondering,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd sure enough I came around the next corner and there was a police stoppage and police tape.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Police quickly identified a suspect vehicle, a 2011-2016 Ford F350 pickup truck. Tips from the public lead police to discover an abandoned boat trailer associated with the case.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then on Nov. 21, just days after Cameron was killed, police announced they had identified a truck on Haida Gwaii with damage consistent with the collision and said they were confident they had identified a suspect driver who was from the Lower Mainland. They seized the suspect F350 truck, another truck and two boat trailers (in addition to the abandoned boat trailer discovered earlier). Police questioned seven people who may have been involved in the incident.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, nothing. The RCMP didn\u2019t quite have enough evidence to recommend charges. Garrett and his family held a press conference on Dec. 19, one month after Cameron was killed, appealing for people to come forward with information.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They were joined by Sgt. Shawn McLaughlin, the primary RCMP member on the case.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cWe will not relent until we deliver the driver responsible [and he] is brought to justice,\u201d Sgt. McLaughlin said at the press conference. \u201cThe last thing I want to see is that those responsible, or those that are hiding evidence \u2026 enjoying their Christmas while forgetting the faces of those you see here today.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">RCMP conducted a search for evidence along Hwy 16 in April 2019, once weather conditions permitted, aided by members of Terrace and Prince Rupert Search and Rescue organizations. The search yielded several pertinent items, police said, though they did not disclose the nature of the items.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since then, the Kerr family has remained focused on asking the suspects, as well as the suspects\u2019 families and friends, to come forward with information. The Kerr family held another public appeal press conference (their third) in November 2019, about a year after Cameron was killed.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And they paid for a letter to be published in Lower Mainland newspapers in April 2020, summarizing their understanding of the incident and pleading for associates of the suspects to come forward.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cTo the parents, wives, girlfriends and friends of a group of men from the Lower Mainland: In November 2018, these men set off for a fishing and hunting trip to Haida Gwaii,\u201d the letter begins.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cAfter passing through Terrace, they were involved in a tragic collision \u2026 after the collision, they spent hours hiding their damaged boat trailer in the woods \u2026 they transferred the boat to the new trailer and proceeded to Haida Gwaii as if nothing had happened. The persons responsible for his death knowingly left Cameron to die alone, not caring enough to call for help.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cTheir trucks, boats and trailers were all impounded by the police, so when they returned to the Lower Mainland, it was without those possessions \u2026 If you recognize these men by this story, the family of Cameron Kerr pleads with you to urge [the suspects] to do the right thing and go to the authorities so that this nightmare can end for Cameron\u2019s family, as well as these individuals.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garrett says the family does not blame the RCMP for the fact that the investigation has not been concluded and they are grateful for the work the RCMP have done.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But they still want justice.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThere is a part of the grieving process that is not available to us while this is hanging over our heads,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sgt. McLaughlin, speaking to <em>The Terrace Standard</em> on Dec. 2, 2020, says he can\u2019t share many details of the current status of the investigation, but he says police are not sitting idly waiting for someone to come forward.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re at a dead end in that regard,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s possible other means that I can\u2019t get into that we might resort to.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He says the RCMP are keeping the Kerr family in the loop as much as possible.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThat\u2019s been a strong goal of ours is to make sure that we\u2019re engaged with the family because we do realize it\u2019s been two years and they want that assurance and they deserve that assurance to know that this hasn\u2019t fallen off our plate,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are still continuing to investigate and use various means to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sgt. McLaughlin added that the investigation has shown police that Cameron was very well respected in his community.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt\u2019s a very important file to the community and it\u2019s a very important file to our membership here,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really close to our hearts and we\u2019re working on it the best we can every day.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The River Kings held tributes to Cameron at home games in 2018 and 2019 and the community showed up in force to both games. Each year, the Terrace Pipes and Drums Society performed at the games in commemoration of Cameron\u2019s Scottish heritage. The team likely would have held a tribute again this year but the league cancelled its season due to the pandemic.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Steve Cullis, captain of the River Kings, is a friend of Garrett and Cameron\u2019s. He was with the brothers at the wake the night Cameron was killed.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt was pretty tough news,\u201d he says. \u201cI want some closure for the family more than anything. How long do they have to keep guessing as to what exactly happened?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garrett says the grief of losing his brother comes in waves.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThe first couple of months it\u2019s just like nothing you could have ever imagined. Then you sort of get to where you just have to be able to function in your life,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are times when I\u2019m just angry \u2026 I don\u2019t know. You just aren\u2019t ever going to be the same.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cAt the same time, I don\u2019t think Cameron would have wanted us all to be in that sort of head space forever either.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In November of this year, near the anniversary of Cameron\u2019s death, a small group of family and friends went to the spot where his body was found to visit a memorial. It\u2019s made of antlers, to repesent his love of hunting, his fishing rod, and kayaking oars to represent his love of paddling.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cameron would have wanted those who love him to come together to support each other in grief, Garrett says, so they have strived to do that, even though it\u2019s been challenging during the pandemic.

Photo courtesy Natasha Candelora.</figcaption></figure>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">B.C. ministry unhelpful in aftermath of fire, family says</h4>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nov. 18, 2020</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By Jake Wray</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Natasha Candelora left her house in Old Remo around 5:10 p.m. on Oct. 7 to take her two children into town for Taekwondo practice. Within an hour, their home burned to the ground, leaving behind only a smoldering pile of rubble.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fire was devastating for the family. Not only did it completely destroy their home and all their possessions (including irreplaceable photographs), it also jeopardized Natasha\u2019s eligibility to continue as a foster parent to the two children, whom she has cared for the last seven years and loves as her own.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She said that day leading up to the fire was a bit hectic but relatively normal. She spent the day on a cleaning frenzy and prepped dinner before rounding the kids up for the trip into town.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was Natasha\u2019s parents, Bob and Barb Wilson, and brother Tony Candelora who saw smoke rising from Natasha\u2019s house. They live right next door in another house on the same property \u2014 a small farm where the family keeps a few horses and domestic pets.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bob and Tony rushed outside when they saw the smoke. Tony didn\u2019t even put on shoes. Bob said they went inside the burning house to get the pets out.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThe whole roof of the house, inside the house, was just swirling with smoke,\u201d Bob said. \u201cThere was no flames or nothing, it was just smoke. Black smoke, just like curls on a woman\u2019s hair \u2026 It was weird. It really was.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tony got the dog, Redford, a rust-coloured doberman, out safely. The cats took care of themselves. Bob and Tony got the rabbits out.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThen we turned around and looked back and the whole roof just come down,\u201d Bob said, noting that when he and Tony opened the door to enter, air flowed up to the fire smoldering in the roof of the home. \u201cProbably within less than 45 seconds the whole thing just come crashing down.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Barb dialed 9-1-1, momentarily forgetting that their property is outside the Thornhill Volunteer Fire Department\u2019s coverage zone. The operator reiterated that fact and dispatched RCMP to assist.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rick Boehm, chief of the Thornhill fire department, told <em>The Terrace Standard </em>that it\u2019s always tough for the fire department when they hear about a fire just outside their protection zone. The zone boundary is a federally-mandated 8-kilometre radius around the fire hall. Firefighters are only allowed to leave their protection boundary when someone\u2019s life is in danger, such as a person trapped in a burning building, which wasn\u2019t the case with this fire.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Barb said it wouldn\u2019t have mattered anyway. From start to finish, the fire only lasted about 20 minutes, and she figures the fire department wouldn\u2019t have been able to react in time.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boehm said that it does indeed take some time to get fire engines out to Old Remo.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThe Old Remo location is sort of compound affected by the significant climb up that hill,\u201d he said. \u201c[Fire engines] can only go so quick on that little road and it is quite a slug to get those heavy, heavy trucks up that hill.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, the kids were at Taekwando and Natasha was relaxing at Cafenara with her boyfriend, Terry Healy, who had just arrived in Terrace that evening after a day of work in Prince Rupert. That\u2019s when Natasha\u2019s cell phone rang.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cMy mom\u2019s yelling at me \u2018Your house is on fire\u2019 and I\u2019m like \u2018what?\u2019\u201d Natasha said. \u201cYou\u2019re in shock when you hear that.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She rushed to gather the children from Taekwando while Terry jumped in his truck and drove like mad out to Old Remo. Even at breakneck speed, the roughly 14-kilometre drive from Terrace to the farm still leaves enough time for one\u2019s mind to churn.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI was wondering how far along the fire was. Can we save anything?\u201d Terry said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that the house was totally gone. I didn\u2019t assume it would be that bad [but] as soon as I started down Queensway, and you look back this way, all you could see is a cloud of black smoke.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Natasha was just minutes behind with the children.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt looked like the whole forest was on fire,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When she arrived, she noticed a collection of onlookers.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cWe had a lineup of people sitting in their cars, and I have to say, for me one of the most awful feelings is people sitting in their vehicle with their windows rolled up watching your house burn down,\u201d Natasha said, tears welling in her eyes as she recalled the memory.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But there were also friendly neighbours who arrived to help. A pair of them comforted Natasha.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThey\u2019re holding me and I\u2019m getting sick beside the car,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming, the grief, the panic that goes through your mind.\u201d</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-517\" data-attachment-id=\"517\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5600\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1604153925\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"18\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.016666666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"candelora-family\" data-large-file=\"https://jakewrayportfolio.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/candelora-family.jpg?w=660\" data-medium-file=\"https://jakewrayportfolio.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/candelora-family.jpg?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https://jakewrayportfolio.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/candelora-family.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3074,2183\" data-permalink=\"https://jakewrayportfolio.wordpress.com/candelora-family/\" height=\"494\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/jakewray-portfolio/media/journalism/foster-family-loses-home-to-fire/foster-family-loses-home-to-fire-2.jpg\" width=\"697\"/><figcaption>Natasha Candelora, centre, relaxes in her parents\u2019 living room on Oct. 30, weeks after the fire, alongside her partner Terry Healy, left, and her father Bob Wilson, right. (Jake Wray/Terrace Standard)</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nearly four weeks after the fire, the smell of smoke still hangs in the air at the family farm. It\u2019s Oct. 30 and the rubble has yet to be cleared. Redford, the doberman, has bandages on his front paws because he cut them mucking about in the debris.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The debris won\u2019t be cleared until Natasha\u2019s insurance processes the claim, and snow might fall before that, meaning cleanup may not happen until next year. Candelora says dealing with the insurance company has been straightforward (the company already supplied emergency funding for a hotel stay and items such as clothes) but the process inherently takes time. She is also waiting for the insurance company to complete an investigation of the fire and determine the cause \u2014 something the fire department would do, if Natasha\u2019s home were within the fire protection district.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The family sits in the living room of Bob and Barb\u2019s home. Natasha is still under a lot of stress trying to sort out new living arrangements and replace essential items, and the whole family is worn out from the ordeal. But they haven\u2019t lost their senses of humour. They all laugh as Barb describes how Natasha\u2019s cats moved themselves, with an air of entitlement, into Bob and Barb\u2019s home.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The children, who are both around 12 years old, are coping fairly well, all things considered. The brother and sister are not identified in this story because provincial policy prevents foster children from being identified in the media. Initially, the girl was scared to go back to school because she was afraid of what all the other kids would say, but when she did go back she found her peers to be caring and supportive. The boy has expressed some anger following the fire.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bob and Natasha also say they are frustrated, particularly with B.C.\u2019s Ministry of Children and Family Development, which oversees the foster care program. Bob and Barb are also foster parents, currently caring for four children. Bob and Barb have been foster parents for 25 years and Natasha has been a foster parent for 19 years. They say the ministry has been insulting and unhelpful in the aftermath of the fire, despite the decades-long relationship between the family and the ministry.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Almost immediately after the fire, a ministry worker informed Natasha that she had 30 days to find a new place or the children could be taken from her because Natasha\u2019s contract with the ministry states she must have her own dwelling with enough bedrooms for each of the children to have their own.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt\u2019s tough some days, but it is equally rewarding or you wouldn\u2019t do it. It\u2019s not for everyone to be a foster parent, but it\u2019s something we\u2019ve chosen as a family to give back. We feel it\u2019s our calling,\u201d Natasha says. \u201cAnd then I don\u2019t have the home any more so now I\u2019m told \u2026 \u2018you have a month to find a suitable place to raise these children.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Candelora says the ministry\u2019s lack of flexibility on the timeline is unreasonable because rental properties are scarce in the Terrace area and the ministry offered no help in locating a rental or financial assistance with rent despite the fact that rent prices are much higher than her monthly mortgage payment. She says the ministry should have contingency funding to support foster families in crises.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cYou would think that there would be maybe something set aside by the government for emergency,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that there isn\u2019t some funding.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She says the notion that her children could be taken from her adds unnecessary pressure to an already stressful situation.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cSo these kids that know no one but me as their mother would have to go live with someone [else],\u201d Natasha says through tears. \u201cIf they\u2019re not with me they\u2019ve been with my parents. They don\u2019t know anyone but us. And they\u2019re going to have to suffer and be punished for something out of all of our control? Because it\u2019s not [ministry] policy?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cWhen we try to resolve situations in the ministry, we always get \u2018well, it\u2019s our policy,\u2019\u201d Bob says. \u201cEven though the policy doesn\u2019t make any common sense, even if you couldn\u2019t live by that policy, we are expected to live by that policy.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ministry offered only limited financial support to replace the children\u2019s belongings like jackets and boots, Bob says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt was very insulting for [ministry workers] to come out here two days after the fire with a dozen donuts and four cups of coffee and $200 for one child and $200 for another child to replace everything that [the children] owned,\u201d Bob says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The family says they could face consequences for speaking out against the ministry, which has a culture of silence, but they are fed up with the mistreatment.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cBecause of what I have said \u2026 I could [metaphorically] have a knife to my throat tomorrow,\u201d Bob says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt\u2019s their own little secret society,\u201d Natasha says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt\u2019s sad. And that\u2019s why in our community we have very few foster parents. And very few relief workers,\u201d Bob says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A manager of the local ministry office refused a request for comment and would not provide a reason why.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Angus Noble, a public affairs officer who works for the ministry at the provincial level, said foster parents are required to have their own home insurance that covers emergencies like fires or floods.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIn addition, [the ministry] supports the availability of \u2018Extended Property Damage (Rider) Insurance\u2019 to supplement a residential caregiver\u2019s homeowner or tenant insurance policy,\u201d Noble said in an email statement. \u201cThis mirrors a foster parent\u2019s basic coverage where damage is caused by a child or youth in care.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Noble said that when a foster parent suddenly loses access to housing, the ministry will work the parent to find a suitable alternative. He said that if the foster parent\u2019s insurance didn\u2019t cover the cost of alternative housing, the ministry may be able to pay for temporary support such as a hotel stay.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u2014 ~ \u2014</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Nov. 5, Natasha said she had finally secured a rental for her and the children. That was a great relief, she said, though many challenges for the family still lie ahead, such as ironing out insurance details, managing the tricky financial situation, and creating a sense of normalcy for the children.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She\u2019s deeply grateful to the Terrace area community who helped her family by donating money and clothing, particularly for the children.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThey\u2019ve got a decent pair of winter boots on their feet,\u201d she said. \u201cWithout the community\u2019s help, honestly I would have been screwed.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Natasha said relying on the community and her family for help can be uncomfortable at times, because she was so proud to have lived as an independent woman raising her children before the fire. Nevertheless, she appreciates the help.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.terracestandard.com/news/foster-family-loses-old-remo-home-to-fire/\">The Terrace Standard.</a></p>\n </div>",

(Mike Dangeli/Instagram)</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Oct. 30, 2020</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By Jake Wray</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mike Dangeli is a Tsimshian, Nisga\u2019a and Tlingit artist and community leader.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He recently carved a memorial totem pole for missing and murdered Indigenous women, and he lead the raising ceremony for the totem pole on Kitsumkalum territory on Sept. 4.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 47-year-old father of three lives in Terrace with his wife Mique\u2019l and their son Hayetsk, who is nearly a year old. Dangeli has two older sons, Nick and Michael, who are in their twenties.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dangeli has been immersed in Northwest Indigenous culture and making art since he was a boy, but he walked a long path before becoming an established, full-time artist.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He was born in the tiny village of Stella, Missouri, near an army base where his biological father was stationed. His family only stayed a few months there \u2014 they moved often due to military obligations. When his parents separated, Dangeli moved with his mom to California, Washington State and finally, southern Alaska.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Growing up, he spent time in southern Alaska and northern B.C., having family roots on both sides of the border.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the summers, he spent countless hours on a boat fishing with his Nisga\u2019a grandfather, who instructed him in Nisga\u2019a <em>adaawk</em> (oral history) and <em>ayuuk</em> (laws and protocol). He also learned from his grandmother, who was a gifted artist.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cNot only did she do beading and weaving and leather work, but she also was a landscape painter as well as a portrait painter,\u201d he said. \u201cHer and my mom were my first art teachers.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Relatives also instructed him in the Tsimshian and Tlingit cultures. On the Tlingit side, he learned to make drums, which he traded for regalia, knowledge or tools.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a teenager, Dangeli played varsity football in Alaska and continued his cultural education on both sides of the border.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When he was 17, he enlisted with the United States Army (to his mother\u2019s dismay), inspired by a long family history of military service. Many of his uncles served in Vietnam and Korea, including his uncle Bill, a marine who fought in the Fall of Saigon in 1975. Both of Dangeli\u2019s grandfathers fought in the Second World War. A great-grandfather on his mother\u2019s side was a member of the Alaska Territorial Guard.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dangeli served 10 years and did four tours of combat. He served in the Army Airborne, the Army Air Assault, and the Army Rangers. Those tours were through the UN\u2019s involvement in the Somali Civil War, during the First Gulf War and at several other locations he cannot discuss.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Confidentiality agreements prevent him from publicly speaking about much of his time in the military, but he left with an honourable discharge.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dangeli has grown critical of his time in the military.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI tell my sons, I\u2019ve been shot and stabbed and chewed enough dirt on foreign soil and fought enough that they don\u2019t have to,\u201d he said. \u201cI look at where I was deployed and who sent me there, and it\u2019s always rich politicians who are sending poor people off to war. I think that\u2019s the way it\u2019s been since the beginning of time. But I just don\u2019t agree with the politics of where they\u2019re sending us as soldiers, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re really fighting for freedom and everything like we\u2019re being told we are.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI still support our troops, because it\u2019s not their choice. They\u2019re not wanting to go do this. They\u2019re just following orders.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Being in the military meant missing out on some of his oldest son\u2019s early years, something Dangeli regretted.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI had him so young and then of course being deployed or away so many times, I felt like I missed a lot. And as a father, you know, that\u2019s a pop in the chops,\u201d he said. \u201cI was able to reconnect and having some amazing time with him as a young pre-teen and teenager and all the way up into his adulthood.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Returning to civilian life was a difficult transition for Dangeli, as it is for so many soldiers. He carried a lot of pain home, but culture and tradition kept him grounded.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201dKnowing who I am, as far as being a Nisga\u2019a/Tlingit/Tsimshian man, and practising my people\u2019s traditions from an early age, being immersed in them \u2026 I really feel like helped me survive all of that,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when I came home with lots of baggage, and was angry about some of the things I had to do in combat. The culture and the art saved my life.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dangeli used the American GI Bill to go back to school in Alaska. He worked as a fisherman and in tourism. He transferred to school in Washington State where, for a time, he was intent on becoming a history teacher. He did an intensive carving apprenticeship under David Boxley, a Tsimshian artist from Metlakatla, Alaska.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then he went through a difficult divorce. Hurting from that, and still bearing some pain from his years of service, Dangeli planned to return to the Nass Valley to lick his wounds. But first he stopped off in Vancouver, where he needed to earn a little cash.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He was asked to complete a totem pole that had been abandoned halfway through the carving process. The original carvers, who seemed to struggle with addiction issues, took an initial payment for work on the pole and then disappeared. Subsequently, the totem pole was stolen twice, ending up on Vancouver Island at one point. It was beaten with a baseball bat. Somebody spray painted a racist name for Indigenous people on it.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dangeli related to the beat-up pole.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt just was abused, so I saw it as a physical manifestation of where I was at,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He ended up getting a grant to have 12 youth work with him on the totem pole project. He taught them how to hold a traditional pole-raising potlatch, how to make gifts for the potlatch, and other protocols.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As many as 500 kids from the Vancouver area came by to help work on the totem pole itself.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt ended up being this really beautiful moment,\u201d Dangeli said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After that, the friendship centre where he had been carving invited him to stay a while, to hold some workshops and things of that nature. He ended up living in the Lower Mainland for 20 years.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He met his wife, Mique\u2019l, when they both apprenticed under the same master carver. Among many other activities over the years, they traveled the world with their dance group Git Hayetsk. They danced all over North America, including on Broadway, and they danced in Germany, Japan and Malaysia.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A few years ago, Dangeli and his wife were both invited to work and teach at \u2018Na Aksa Gyilak\u2019yoo School in Kitsumkalum, so they moved to Terrace. They\u2019ve been here since.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Normally the family are quite busy, working on various art projects, teaching or speaking engagements, or cultural activities on both sides of the border. But with COVID-19 and the border closure, they are having a relatively quiet year.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dangeli wished he could have seen his older sons more this year, but he relishes being able to spend quality time at home, especially with his son Hayetsk being at a formative age. Hayetsk has been immersed in his father\u2019s artwork this year, participating in carving in his own way. The little guy is already beginning to learn the cultural lessons that saved his father years ago.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201dHe loves coming in when I\u2019m in my painting studio, coming and looking over things,\u201d Dangeli said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing to see this little toddler emulate so much of what is going on in his life.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.terracestandard.com/community/skeena-voices-the-culture-and-the-art-saved-my-life/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Terrace Standard.</a></p>\n </div>",

The resulting lava flow is believed to have killed approximately 2,000 Nisga\u2019a people, destroying three villages in the Nass Valley. This scientific understanding is corroborated by Nisga\u2019a oral history. Now the vast fields of lava rock are preserved as a provincial park, jointly managed by the Nisga\u2019a Lisims government and the B.C. government.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The volcano has been researched before, but until now there had never been extensive mapping of the volcano cone or the beds of lava rock that were formed when lava flowed 32 km into the valley, nor had a precise timeline of events been established.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In summer 2016, researchers from SFU, UBC, and Quest University in Squamish began fieldwork in the lava beds, returning again in the summers of 2017 and 2019. They studied the surface of the lava beds, measured the depth of the lava beds at various points, and measured the depth of Lava Lake and Melita Lake, to determine how much lava had flowed into those waters. The researchers also obtained aerial photos of the volcano cone and lava beds. The data was then punched into 3D modelling software for further insight.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The research culminated in a paper called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17445647.2020.1758809\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Physical</a><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17445647.2020.1758809\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> volcanology of Tseax </a><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17445647.2020.1758809\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Volcano,</a>\u201d which was published online May 12. Lead author of the paper Yannick Le Moigne is a PhD candidate at SFU and the paper is his PhD thesis.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Le Moigne told <em>The Terrace Standard </em>that the biggest surprise from the research was just how much lava flowed from the relatively small volcano.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThe volcano is very, very small compared to the lava flow,\u201d he said, comparing the size of the lava flow to the size of the Skeena River today. \u201c[It was] an enormous volume of lava flow, very hot \u2026 flowing like a river in the valleys, reaching the [Nisga\u2019a] villages in a day or two, destroying everything in its path.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many of the Nisga\u2019a people were killed by a poisonous gas, not the lava itself, according to Nisga\u2019a oral history that was recorded in the Canadian Geographical Journal in 1935. Le Moigne said that is likely true, but he and other researchers can only speculate about gasses related to the eruption.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThey were not necessarily killed by the lava flow, but maybe once the lava flow arrived, was in contact with the Nass River, there would have been some gas emissions,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have \u2026 a very hot lava flow, in contact with the cold water like the Nass River, you have a lot of emissions of vapor of water, but also any volcanic gasses like CO2, sulphuric gasses, etc., and if you smell those gasses you could be in trouble.\u201d</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-487\" data-attachment-id=\"487\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"200611-tst-tseax-volcano-2\" data-large-file=\"https://jakewrayportfolio.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/200611-tst-tseax-volcano-2.jpeg?w=660\" data-medium-file=\"https://jakewrayportfolio.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/200611-tst-tseax-volcano-2.jpeg?w=246\" data-orig-file=\"https://jakewrayportfolio.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/200611-tst-tseax-volcano-2.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"1500,1831\" data-permalink=\"https://jakewrayportfolio.wordpress.com/200611-tst-tseax-volcano-2/\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/jakewray-portfolio/media/journalism/scientists-produce-extensive-map-of-tseax-volcano-lava-flow/scientists-produce-extensive-map-of-tseax-volcano-lava-flow-2.jpeg\" width=\"839\"/></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Tseax Volcano is unlikely to erupt again, Le Moigne said. It was formed as the result of rifting, where two tectonic places pull apart, thinning the Earth\u2019s crust and allowing magma to spill out from the Earth\u2019s mantle. This process typically results in volcanos that only erupt once, which is true for most volcanos in northern B.C. and Alaska.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cAll these volcanos, like 90 per cent of them, are monogenetic volcanos, because they only erupted one time, and then [they stop],\u201d Le Moigne said. \u201cSo, at the moment, we are thinking that Tseax is also a monogenetic volcano \u2026 But we are not 100 per cent sure, maybe in the future there will be another eruption.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Le Moigne, who is from France, said he chose to come work on the Tseax Volcano for his PhD because the volcano had barely been studied.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt was an opportunity to study everything, from the basic, to the more complex history of the volcano,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nisga\u2019a people provided great assistance to the research, Le Moigne said, a contribution not available in most earth science studies.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThey gave us a lot of data from their oral histories, and that helped us a lot when we wrote, step by step, what happened at Tseax,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very cool project to merge the two aspects of the world. You have the [earth] science, and then you have the \u2026 social science from the Nisga\u2019a.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.terracestandard.com/news/scientists-produce-extensive-map-of-tseax-volcano-lava-flow/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Terrace Standard.</a></p>\n </div>",

What is that?\u2019 It\u2019s a deep adherence to nature and natural law, and attention to the cycles of the Earth and the lives within it,\u201d Blackett told <em>The Terrace Standard</em>. \u201cWe work in love and light.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blackett said witches have been oppressed for hundreds of years because their beliefs threatened mainstream religious teachings.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut we\u2019re back,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen are invoking the witch to find their power in a patriarchal society.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blackett explained that there is a formal religion built on the values of witchcraft, called Wicca, but not all witches are Wiccan and not all Wiccans are witches. She said she doesn\u2019t necessarily consider herself a Wiccan, but her shop is there to support Wiccans (and any other religion, for that matter.)</p>\n<p>\u201cWicca is an actual religion, and it is the fastest growing faith right now in North America, and pretty much the world at this point,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are definitely in a state right now of the awakening. Everybody\u2019s feelin\u2019 it. The Earth is really waking up and there\u2019s big changes and a lot of people are diving into their spirituality, whether it\u2019s Buddhist, Christian or Wiccan, it doesn\u2019t really matter. The shop is here for that purpose. I mean, you can be a Jedi, I don\u2019t care. We\u2019re going to help you find the Force.\u201d</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>One way the shop could help a person, Blackett said, would be to help them find a crystal with vibrations that really speak to that person, helping them feel spiritually at peace. The shop also sells sage for smudging, which can help get rid of negative vibrations.</p>\n<p>The shop also offers workshops. In 2019, Blackett hosted a women\u2019s retreat that included yoga, meditation, music, dance, and herbalism, among many other activities. She said it was incredibly rewarding to host it and she hopes to do another soon.</p>\n<p>\u201cHelping women is a very big thing for me,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Blackett was born and raised in the Smithers area, where she lived for many years before moving to Terrace. She raised three boys, who are now 29, 27, and 25 years old. She worked for about 17 years doing deliveries for Canada Post in rural areas around Smithers.</p>\n<p>Throughout that whole time, she was discovering her psychic talent. She said she was around 8 when she first sensed that she was channeling energies and spirits around her, but she didn\u2019t have a full understanding of what was happening at the time. As a teenager, she sort of lost connection with those senses.</p>\n<p>She became an avid traveler in her early 20s, and on a trip to Europe she had a sudden reconnection with her psychic abilities.</p>\n<p>She was standing on the wall of the Tower of London in England.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was when my first experience happened, big time. I had a past life there, apparently, and I died there,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>She heard a cacophony of voices of the dead. It was like the sound of a party in the background of a phone call, she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy sister had to pretty much pull me out of there, and I could just hear them getting angrier and angrier because I wasn\u2019t understanding what they were doing,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Upon returning to Smithers, she had another flash of the past life in England. She was riding in a car with her then-husband, a friend, and her oldest boy, when suddenly she was in the back of a horse-drawn carriage.</p>\n<p>After the second flash, she sought the guidance of a more experienced medium who helped her understand what she was seeing.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure enough, I was in the peasants revolt. I was a woman at that time, with a bunch of men traveling by boat to go see the king, the young boy king. If he sees us, they\u2019ll listen to us. And they threw me in a pit with my comrades from my village, and we were left to die there. And [I] died there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Over time, she learned to protect herself from dark visions of the past and to better manage her abilities.</p>\n<p>She started doing psychic readings for people she knew, eventually setting up a room in her home to perform the ceremonies. Interest in her services grew and grew, until finally, nine years ago, she officially opened up a shop offering related goods and services in Smithers.</p>\n<p>Several years after opening her shop in Smithers, Blackett met her now-partner, who is from Terrace, through a dating site. When she first met him she was very impressed, but scared too. Dating can be tough, she said, when you have to tell prospective partners that you\u2019re a witch and a psychic. But he was totally accepting. The two quickly became close, and she decided to move from Smithers to Terrace four years ago.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a big decision. Smithers is my home, everybody\u2019s there,\u201d she said, noting that the community in Terrace has been extremely welcoming to her.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis has been such a wonderful, wonderful area to grow my business and meet new friends and opportunities \u2026 And the merchants have been awesome, just wonderful.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blackett said in all her years of running her shop, both in Smithers and in Terrace, no one has openly expressed hate toward her for her beliefs or lifestyle.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt really is no worries to me if you don\u2019t believe me or anything. That\u2019s okay. That\u2019s totally fine. You\u2019re just not where we are yet,\u201d she said.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",

    "content_html": "<p>After years of planning, a commemoration and healing totem pole honouring missing and murdered Indigenous women will be raised at a highway pullout on Kitsumkalum territory west of Terrace in September.</p>\n<p>The totem pole is not just for missing and murdered Indigenous women \u2014 in a way, it\u2019s also for missing and murdered people of all ages, colours and genders, as well as for two-spirit and LGBTQ people. That\u2019s because totem poles represent fluid, metaphorical ideas and should not be interpreted in direct, concrete terms, said Mike Dangeli, the lead artist carving the totem pole.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe reading isn\u2019t necessarily \u2018this means this\u2019 or \u2018this equals this\u2019 like in the English language,\u201d he said.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Arlene Roberts, who is a key organizer of the memorial totem pole and Dangeli\u2019s mom, said the physical monument is less important than the message it sends.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to have the courage and step forward in saying \u2018No more. No more stolen sisters.\u2019 It\u2019s time to make a cultural statement, a traditional statement,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about is honouring the families, and it\u2019s treasuring the souls and spirits of the stolen sisters and boys and men, it\u2019s honouring the two-spirited LGBTQ \u2026 and they\u2019re not just First Nations. There are non-First-Nations who are going missing as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>The idea to create a memorial came from Gladys Radek, a local advocate for missing and murdered Indigenous women. After her niece Tamara Chipman disappeared near Prince Rupert in 2005, Radek started organizing awareness walks \u2014 including a walk from Vancouver to Prince Rupert, and a walk across Canada. Eventually, Radek became involved with the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls as an advisor and as an advocate for families coming forward to share stories.</p>\n<p>During all that hard work that began years ago with awareness walks, she said, she always envisioned creating a memorial for families in the Northwest.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is kind of closing the circle for me from the walks,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted a space where our families could go, to find a little bit of healing, a little bit of peace, and a little bit of honouring their loved ones.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dangeli, an artist with Nisga\u2019a, Tsimshian, Tlingit and Tsetsaut heritage, has been working on the totem pole under a tent in his back yard on Terrace\u2019s Southside since September, alongside his adult sons Michael Dangeli and Nick Dangeli. He\u2019s carved more than 20 totem poles but never one so close to home in the Northwest, he said.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>The 24-foot totem pole is is not fully carved yet, but some of the figures are starting to take shape. Dangeli pointed out the main and largest figure on the totem pole, a young woman who will have a red dress and face paint. She will represent missing and murdered indigenous women. Above her is a matriarch figure. The bottom figure, which is a crucial figure because it bears the weight of the totem pole, is a killer whale, to acknowledge that the totem pole will be on Kitsumkalum killer whale clan territory. Many other figures will adorn the totem pole when it is ready.</p>\n<p>Originally the totem pole was meant to be completed in time for a June 5 raising ceremony, but the ceremony was postponed until September because of the pandemic. That was fortunate, Dangeli said, because it allowed the artistic team to slow down their timeline and work with extra care.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause of the energy and the subject matter, it\u2019s really important that we get it done right,\u201d he said. \u201cMy sons, before we even touched it in the raw log form, I took them out on the Skeena River, and we did ritual bathing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen it was just still a log but shaped out to be a pole \u2026 We had the kids come down and sweep it with cedar boughs, and again, water from the Skeena, just to bless it and we had elders and chiefs and matriarchs come down to just get it in a good way.\u201d</p>\n<p>The raising ceremony will take place Sept. 4 and Sept. 5 in what Dangeli called a \u201cvirtual potlatch\u201d to accommodate pandemic precaution measures.</p>\n<p>The totem pole will be raised on Sept. 4, and the following day dancers, chiefs and matriarchs will breath life into the totem pole.</p>\n<p>Only a small group of people will be physically present at any given time, but the event will be live-streamed by CFNR so anyone can participate from home.</p>\n<p>The memorial totem pole project has received plenty of funding and other support, Roberts said.</p>\n<p>She is grateful to co-organizers Marc Snelling and Wanda Good, as well as Highway of Tears families, friends and walkers, the Indian Residential School Survivors Society (where she also works), Kitsumkalum chiefs and matriarchs, Women and Gender Equality Canada, and B.C.\u2019s ministry of transportation.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve just had some incredible people coming along the line and saying, \u2018What can we do? How can we help you paddle, make this journey in this canoe?\u2019\u201d Roberts said.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img alt=\"22181871_web1_200723-TST-memorial-totem-pole-crew-WEB\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/jakewray-portfolio/media/journalism/highway-of-tears-memorial-totem-pole-to-be-raised-on-kitsumkalum-territory-west-of-terrace/22181871_web1_200723-TST-memorial-totem-pole-crew-WEB.jpg\"/><figcaption>A memorial totem pole in honour of missing and murdered Indigenous women will be raised in September.

    "content_html": "<p>A Terrace couple and their two dogs had a terrifying encounter with wolves while camping over the May long weekend.</p>\n<p>Friday Bailey and her partner Nathan Meakes spent the night of Friday May 15 camping in the back of their truck at a cut block near the Onion Lake Cross Country Ski Trails. They had just woken up around 7:30 Saturday morning and they were cuddling in bed with their dog Cash, a 7-year-old lab mix, while their other dog Arlo, a 10-year-old Huskey/collie mix, lounged outside the truck.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know that time in the morning where you\u2019re not up and going yet, but you\u2019re awake?\u201d Bailey asked in an interview with <em>The Terrace Standard.</em></p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Suddenly, Cash bolted out of bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe saw that it was wolves that had approached the camp \u2026 they were huge,\u201d Bailey said. \u201c[Arlo] and the wolves were rushing toward each other, and then [Cash] jumped out of the truck and just totally intervened.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bailey said the dogs and wolves clashed for about 10 seconds, then the dogs chased the wolves toward the bush at the edge of the cut block.</p>\n<p>\u201c[Nate and I] were just running after them and screaming and yelling and just going ballistic,\u201d she said. \u201cJust trying to scare the wolves off, and trying to get our dogs back.\u201d</p>\n<p>After a few minutes Arlo came back to the couple and Bailey was able to hold his collar. Cash returned to check on the couple, but then went back to pursuing the wolves, and he repeated this a few times before the wolves eventually took off.</p>\n<p>There were only two wolves, Bailey said.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cThank God. I don\u2019t think [the dogs] could have fought off any more,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think the wolves were going to come after humans, but we definitely thought they would kill a dog.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bailey said she suspects the wolves spotted Arlo alone outside the truck and didn\u2019t realize there was another dog and two humans hidden from view.</p>\n<p>The couple are experienced campers, Bailey said. They had their food stored safely atop the truck and were carrying bear spray.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are really safe campers, but we didn\u2019t expect wolves to approach our camp in the daylight,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it was night time the dogs would have been in the [cab of the] truck and everyone would have been secure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arlo suffered only minor scratches on his face, but Cash had a big bite mark on his neck, a scratch on his groin, and other bruises and abrasions.</p>\n<p>Finding a veterinarian to treat Cash on Saturday of a long weekend, and in the middle of the pandemic, was a major challenge. Bailey said the couple had to phone around to six places in Terrace, Rupert and Kitimat before finally finding someone who was available to treat Cash. The couple had to drop Cash off outside the veterinary office as they could not enter due to the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Bailey said they reported the incident to the B.C. Conservation Officer Service.</p>\n<p>Both dogs are recovering at home, Bailey said, though Cash was sedated by painkillers for days after the encounter.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",

The referendum required over 50 per cent of PC Alberta votes and 75 per cent of Wildrose Party votes in order to pass. 95 per cent of the ballots from each party were cast in favour of unity.</p>\n<p>The new conglomerate party, called the United Conservative Party (UCP), is now the official opposition in Alberta\u2019s legislature. The UCP selected Nathan Cooper, who came into the UCP as a Wildrose Party MLA, to serve as its interim leader until the actual leadership vote on Oct. 28.</p>\n<p>Jim Lightbody, a political scientist at the University of Alberta, said there is still plenty of work to be done in merging the two parties.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of mechanical stuff. Integrating constitutions, figuring out how to deal with financial rules,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got two quite autonomous organizations here. Even though they\u2019ve voted to unite, each thinks they\u2019re better than the other. There\u2019s going to be a lot of personalities that have to be dealt with, so it\u2019s a long path to get to the unified party.\u201d</p>\n<p>The core principles of the UCP won\u2019t be finalized until a leader is elected in October, according to Lightbody. He said PC Alberta leader Jason Kenney and Wildrose Party leader Brian Jean are likely to be the frontrunners in that leadership race.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause of their experience being leaders and because of the fact that they will have had close working relations with many of the people who will form the party executive and the two caucuses in the legislature, whether that will present an insurmountable barrier, I think it will, to someone from outside coming in, remains to be seen,\u201d Lightbody said. \u201cThere\u2019s no one in the legislature who has sufficient standing to be taken seriously (as a leadership candidate) in comparison to Kenney and Jean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gord Molnar, a Wildrose Party member (and now UCP member) from Stony Plain, said he will keep an open mind throughout the leadership race.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will be open moving forward, with how each of the candidates present themselves, because I don\u2019t know all the candidates very well, but I do know Brian Jean. If I had to vote today, I\u2019d vote for Brian Jean,\u201d Molnar said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really (strike) me as being one of the old boys\u2019 club. He seems to be a little bit of, I guess, a revolutionary. He\u2019s got some very strong credentials. He\u2019s a lawyer by trade, but he\u2019s also a trapper, so when you look at blue-collar/white-collar, he fits the mould of probably (the majority) of the populace.\u201d</p>\n<p>Molnar said he voted in favour of unification. His biggest concern moving forward, he said, is that core Wildrose Party values could get put aside in the merger.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only fear that I have is maybe losing some of those grassroots principles, where everyone has a voice. Like, even the MLAs I think within the Wildrose, they\u2019re allowed a free vote. They\u2019re allowed to vote on conscience. They don\u2019t necessarily have to toe the party line,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are things that are really held strong in my view, is the fact that you can be free in the Wildrose. You can speak what you want to speak and you can do what you want to do without recourse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Article originally appeared in <a href=\"http://www.sprucegroveexaminer.com/2017/07/27/conservative-parties-merge-after-referendum\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Spruce Grove Examiner</a></p>\n </div>",

Homeowners beyond the range have complained of stray bullets. \u2013 Photo by Jake Wray Reporter/Examiner</figcaption></figure>\n<p>July 20, 2017</p>\n<p>By Jake Wray</p>\n<p>The Spruce Grove Gun Club (SGGC) has begun a defamation lawsuit, by filing a statement of claim, against Parkland County Mayor Rod Shaigec.</p>\n<p>The statement of claim, which was filed on July 13 at the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Edmonton, is centred on comments Shaigec allegedly made about another lawsuit against the SGGC. Darren and Natasha Degeer, who owned a home downrange from the SGGC, sued the gun club in 2014 after finding a bullet lodged in the wall of their house. The Degeers eventually dropped their case against the SGGC and it was never legally established that the bullet lodged in their house came from the SGGC.</p>\n<p>According to Bill Newton, a spokesperson for the SGGC, the new defamation suit is in response to an email the SGGC says that Shaigec sent to a county resident implying that the bullet that hit the Degeers\u2019 house had in fact come from the SGGC.</p>\n<p>\u201c(Shaigec wrote that) the bullet that hit the Degeer\u2019s home was fired from a semi-automatic firearm and that semi-automatic firearms can only be fired on a range like (the SGGC\u2019s range,) legally,\u201d Newton said. \u201cHis comment that semi-automatic firearms can only be used on a range \u2014 that\u2019s completely inaccurate. Guys can hunt deer with semi-automatic rifles, and do, so why (Mayor Shaigec) would say that, I don\u2019t know, but it certainly is, in our mind, defamatory.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shaigec did not respond to interview requests by press deadline.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit was filed just days after Parkland County council took the first steps toward enacting a bylaw amendment that would jeopardize the SGGC. On July 11 council voted 5-2 in favour of the first reading of a Land Use Bylaw amendment that would prohibit outdoor shooting ranges in land zoned as country residential. The property where SGGC has operated since the early seventies is currently zoned as country residential.</p>\n<p>At the Parkland County council meeting on July 11, nearly 20 members of the public made statements to council about the bylaw amendment, including Greg Zederayko, a member of the SGGC who asked Shaigec to \u201crecuse himself\u201d from voting on the amendment.</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe, as do many others, that the mayor has demonstrated a longstanding bias toward the SGGC, (and) has already made up his mind that the council should amend the bylaw as presented,\u201d Zederayko said. \u201cIt\u2019s alleged that in 2013 the mayor told them and other residents that the County would not renew the (SGGC\u2019s) development permit once it expired in June 2014. As we know, the mayor and council are not entitled to input as to whether or not a development permit should be renewed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shaigec responded immediately to Zederayko\u2019s accusations.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will not recuse myself. I have demonstrated in my seven years of public service that I consider the facts from all parties when deliberating any matter that comes before council, and I will do so with this particular issue that\u2019s before council for debate and discussion. I will do so without prejudice,\u201d Shaigec said. \u201cI can state unequivocally, for the record, that I did not make, nor did any council member, make any statement to any member of the public or the (SGGC) that I would direct, or any council member would ensure, that a development permit would not be issued.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shaigec has until Aug. 2 to file a statement of defence, or a demand for notice, in response or he risks automatically losing the lawsuit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.sprucegroveexaminer.com/2017/07/20/gun-club-sues-parkland-county-mayor/wcm/4c816862-c6c1-4d5b-0834-58f6ece8da1e\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Spruce Grove Examiner</a></p>\n </div>",

Photo by Roberto Teixeira</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Dec. 2, 2016</p>\n<p>By Chahira Merarsi and Jake Wray</p>\n<p>Bullying council members into silence, staff resisting changes by elected members, and booze on the students\u2019 dime are just a few of the accusations being levelled against the Langara Students\u2019 Union by sources who talked exclusively to <em>The Voice.</em></p>\n<p>The allegations come on the heels of the abrupt firing of the LSU\u2019s general manager Desmond Rodenbour, who claims he was hired to implement reform. At the same meeting, the LSU also fired its legal counsel, which had recommended Rodenbour, and an elected board member.</p>\n<p>Harsimran Malhi, who was elected in this year\u2019s spring election, said she was fired last week after spending months trying to enact reform in the student union.</p>\n<h4>Staff allegedly threatened board members</h4>\n<p>Malhi said the LSU staff threatened to take legal action if she kept trying to improve transparency and modernize the union.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were threatened a few times,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like we were told \u2018you\u2019ll face grievances because this is not something that is our job.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Officially, she was fired for missing two board meetings. She said she had alerted the GM that she would miss the meetings for personal issues that had come up.</p>\n<p>Malhi said she felt like some staff were unsupportive.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe saw threats were given to us because we were trying to ask for policies because if you don\u2019t know what the policies say, how can you do something?\u201d She added that as a council member, they would be \u201caccused of things again and again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malhi said it was made very clear to her when she was elected, that asking questions was not seen favourably by the staff.</p>\n<p>Malhi said staff also balked when council members discussed hiring legal counsel.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey basically walked out of the meeting,\u201d she told <em>The Voice</em>. \u201cWe wanted everyone to be on board. But the reaction that we got was really unexpected.\u201d</p>\n<h4>Allegations of financial impropriety</h4>\n<p>Emma Leigha Munro, a former LSU member-at-large, said she witnesssed questionable financial decisions, although Malhi claims she never witnessed any evidence of that.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere were definitely things that were questionable,\u201d Munro said Thursday. \u201cSuch as alcoholic beverages at a party, open tabs, board parties, Christmas parties.\u201d</p>\n<p>Munro told <em>The Voice</em> that she was suspicious of LSU spending and her feeling was that staff wielded the real power in the LSU while elected members were treated as pawns.</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel like they ran the whole thing and we were just there because they needed it to look like we were there,\u201d Munro said.</p>\n<p>Another source familiar with the LSU said he was unimpressed with the way things were run and staff often pressured council members to do their bidding.</p>\n<p>The source expressed concern about the number of people pushed out over the last 16 months.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s essentially like putting Langara back into the dark ages,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p><em>The Voice</em> reached out for comment from the LSU, which did not respond.</p>\n<p>Another issue raised was how staff tried to prevent elected board members from connecting with other student societies, including the umbrella Alliance of B.C. Students.</p>\n<p>In an April 2016 email obtained by <em>The Voice</em>, LSU staff member Gurbax Lealh instructed ABCS officials to always contact LSU staff before approaching elected LSU council members.</p>\n<p><em>The Voice</em>, Thursday, attempted to contact the LSU for comment and got no response.</p>\n<p>Langara College officials also declined to comment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Article originally appeared in\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://www.langaravoice.ca/2016/12/02/lsu-accused-of-misconduct/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Langara Voice</a></em></p>\n </div>",
