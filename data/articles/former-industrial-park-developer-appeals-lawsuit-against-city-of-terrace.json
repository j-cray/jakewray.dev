  "content_html": "<p>Six million dollars are once again on the line for Terrace and Kitselas First Nation.</p>\n<p>Taisheng International Investment Services, the former developer of the Skeena Industrial Development Park (SIDP), is appealing a court decision from October 2025 that saw a joint venture between the City of Terrace and Kitselas First Nation keep a $6 million construction deposit from Taisheng after the developer did not build a groundwater system at the SIDP.</p>\n<p>Court documents obtained by <em>The Terrace Standard</em> show that an appeal was filed in November 2025 but do not list an argument for the appeal. Representatives of Taisheng Internatioal Investment Services did not respond to request for comment by press deadline.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>A spokesperson for the City of Terrace confirmed the City is still in litigation for the $6 million, and said that the City is currently lobbying higher levels of government for money to get the groundwater system built at the SIDP.</p>\n<p>\u201cBased on Taisheng incomplete drawings it is believed very rough (no quotes involved yet) $32 million dollar cost to get water in the park,\u201d the spokesperson said in an email. \u201cHence, we are in the process of lobbying the government for a package of money that won\u2019t set Terrace back even further.\u201d</p>\n<p>The decision in October dismissed a lawsuit from Taisheng International Investment Services seeking to recover the $6 million deposit. The judge, Justice Underhill, stated that Taisheng was not entitled to the return of the deposit after it failed to meet contractual deadlines, which ultimately led the City of Terrace to repurchase the lands.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo find otherwise,\u201d the justice wrote, \u201cwould result in Taisheng receiving a $6.18 million windfall.\u201d</p>\n<p>The case originates from a 2014 agreement where Taisheng agreed to purchase 1,187 acres of land from the city for $11.878 million. The contract required Taisheng to develop the lands into an industrial park, which included constructing a road and a groundwater system.</p>\n<p>Under the agreement, Taisheng was eligible for reimbursements for this infrastructure work if it met specific deadlines. The city agreed to reimburse Taisheng approximately $6.18 million for the construction of the groundwater system.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>By 2019, with the system still not built, the parties executed an amendment to their contract. In a transaction that occurred on June 28, 2019, the City of Terrace paid Taisheng the $6,183,686.80 \u201cgroundwater reimbursement.\u201d On the same day, Taisheng paid the exact same amount back to the city, where it was held as a \u201cconstruction deposit\u201d to be used as security for the completion of the water system.</p>\n<p>According to the court decision, Taisheng failed to meet the construction milestones set out in the development plan. As a result, the City of Terrace exercised its option to purchase the land back on Oct. 15, 2021, a move that was validated in a separate arbitration proceeding. The lands were officially transferred back to the city on Oct. 4, 2023.</p>\n<p>A day later, Taisheng demanded the return of its $6.18 million deposit, arguing that since the city now owned the land, it could not use the deposit for its intended purpose. In a joint statement, the City of Terrace and Kitselas First Nation confirmed the \u201cconstruction deposit will be retained by the Joint Venture to be used on the park\u2019s groundwater system,\u201d which is now estimated to cost over $14 million.</p>\n<p>Taisheng argued that the contract\u2019s terms meant the deposit could only be used for work \u201cattributable to the purchaser\u201d (Taisheng) and that the city exercising its buy-back option made this impossible. Justice Underhill rejected this interpretation, calling it \u201ccommercially absurd.\u201d He found the contract\u2019s language was \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d that the money was security.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe intention of the parties, reflected in the language of the purchase agreement, is clear,\u201d the decision said. \u201cThe purpose of the transaction was to see the SIDP developed, and it was expressly structured to secure Taisheng\u2019s commitments to proceed with that development in a timely manner, failing which Terrace could repurchase the lands.\u201d</p>\n<p>The judge also dismissed Taisheng\u2019s alternative argument that keeping the deposit amounted to an \u201cunenforceable penalty.\u201d He ruled the deposit was not \u201cunconscionable\u201d or \u201cpenal,\u201d especially given the high cost of the water system.</p>\n<p><em>\u2014With files from Rod Link</em></p>",
