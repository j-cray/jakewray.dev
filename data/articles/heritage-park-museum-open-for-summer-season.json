  "content_html": "<p>The Heritage Park Museum has officially started its active summer season, though the season will be short this year.</p>\n<p>The museum relies on federal funding to hire summer students each year who run the majority of the summer programming, such as tours and exhibits. This year, a little less federal funding was provided, so the museum will probably wind down its summer programming at the start of August, one month earlier than usual, said curator Anna Glass.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the museum has four summer students and plenty going on in June and July.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Small groups of people are welcome to drop by the museum and sign up for self-guided tours with pamphlets highlighting museum features.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve actually only had one group so far, but it seemed to go well,\u201d Glass said.</p>\n<p>There will be monthly featured exhibits. This month\u2019s exhibit showcases some of Terrace\u2019s medical history from the mid-20th Century, supplemented by a donation of artifacts from Northern Drugs.</p>\n<p>The museum is offering space to 2020 grads and their families who wish to take grad photos. Groups can drop by during regular museum hours from June 16 \u2013 20.</p>\n<p>One summer student has created a \u201chistory hotline\u201d where folks can call in to either share knowledge or learn.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have trivia, they can talk about historical events, anything they remember,\u201d Glass said.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>The number for the history hotline is 250-615-6406 and it\u2019s open from Tuesday to Saturday between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.</p>\n<p>Hand sanitizer is available at the front gate. There will be a limit of 30 people allowed in the museum at any given time, Glass said, lower than the province\u2019s limit of gatherings of 50.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlthough our park and our site is quite large, the buildings on it are smaller. So we\u2019re setting a smaller occupancy limit, just to be extra safe and make sure everything is manageable,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Glass said it\u2019s nice having the summer students around, since she works more-or-less alone outside of summer.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur museum cat loves the company as well,\u201d she said.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",
