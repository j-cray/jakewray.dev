We\u2019re doing our best but it does start to weigh on the staff.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cWe are running on fumes for way too many of our shifts.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hospital staff feel frustrated as many of the COVID-19 patients they are treating seem to have not followed public health protocols, Dr. McCoach said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cA lot of the cases are from people not doing their part at the societal level and they\u2019re still partying, they\u2019re still socializing, they\u2019re still not taking the pandemic seriously in the way it needs to be, and unfortunately [hospital staff] are suffering because of that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really does threaten the stability of our health care system if COVID is allowed to run unchecked. I think people need to get that message a little bit clearer.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt\u2019s not a hoax. It\u2019s not influenza. It\u2019s not just a flu season that will go away. It is something that needs to be taken seriously, and really the fate of our medical system remains in the public\u2019s hands.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Dr. McCoach acknowledged the difficulties that come with pandemic safety measures.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cWe know people are tired. It\u2019s not an easy thing to ask,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are real harms from changing the way we socialize and interact but, fundamentally, this remains in [the public\u2019s] hands.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There have been COVID-19-related deaths at Mills Memorial Hospital, Dr. McCoach said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cWhen you see people that got sick sometimes having done the right thing, doing their best to stay at home, doing their best to isolate \u2026 Seeing people like that get sick, that is very demoralizing,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dr. McCoach said fewer than 20 hospital staff have received vaccines so far, but its arrival still provides some hope on the horizon for staff.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked what the public can do to help the situation and support front-line staff, beyond adhering to public health protocols, Dr. McCoach said simple gestures of gratitude would be immensely helpful.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThere is a very large team of people as well that are putting in a lot of extra hours, from pharmacy staff, physio staff, occupational therapy, the public health teams \u2026 the housekeeping staff who have gone above and beyond the call of duty,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you know somebody, send a little message just to say thank you. It is very, very difficult and demoralizing right now, and we need the extra thank-yous.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cEspecially the nurses \u2014 they have moved mountains to make sure the community remains safe.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.thenorthernview.com/news/its-not-a-hoax-terrace-hospital-busier-than-ever-with-covid-19-cases-5978773\">The Terrace Standard.</a></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n </div>",
