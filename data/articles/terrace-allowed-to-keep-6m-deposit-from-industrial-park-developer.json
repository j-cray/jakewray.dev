  "content_html": "<p>The City of Terrace and Kitselas First Nation have won a siginificant legal battle over the Skeena Industrial Development Park (SIDP) after a Supreme Court of British Columbia decision allowed them to keep a $6 million deposit from a former developer.</p>\n<p>The decision, delivered by summary trial, dismisses a lawsuit from Taisheng International Investment Services Inc., which sought the return of the funds after a massive project at the SIDP fell through.</p>\n<p>In the ruling, Justice Underhill found that the $6.18 million was a \u201ctrue deposit\u201d intended as security to ensure Taisheng constructed a groundwater system for the park. The judge stated that Taisheng was not entitled to the return of the deposit after it failed to meet contractual deadlines, which ultimately led the City of Terrace to repurchase the lands.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cTo find otherwise,\u201d the justice wrote, \u201cwould result in Taisheng receiving a $6.18 million windfall.\u201d</p>\n<p>The case originates from a 2014 agreement where Taisheng agreed to purchase 1,187 acres of land from the city for $11.878 million. The contract required Taisheng to develop the lands into an industrial park, which included constructing a road and a groundwater system.</p>\n<p>Under the agreement, Taisheng was eligible for reimbursements for this infrastructure work if it met specific deadlines. The city agreed to reimburse Taisheng approximately $6.18 million for the construction of the groundwater system.</p>\n<p>By 2019, with the system still not built, the parties executed an amendment to their contract. In a transaction that occurred on June 28, 2019, the City of Terrace paid Taisheng the $6,183,686.80 \u201cgroundwater reimbursement.\u201d On the same day, Taisheng paid the exact same amount back to the city, where it was held as a \u201cconstruction deposit\u201d to be used as security for the completion of the water system.</p>\n<p>According to the court decision, Taisheng failed to meet the construction milestones set out in the development plan. As a result, the City of Terrace exercised its option to purchase the land back on Oct. 15, 2021, a move that was validated in a separate arbitration proceeding. The lands were officially transferred back to the city on Oct. 4, 2023.</p>\n<p>A day later, Taisheng demanded the return of its $6.18 million deposit, arguing that since the city now owned the land, it could not use the deposit for its intended purpose.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>In a joint statement, the City of Terrace and Kitselas First Nation confirmed the \u201cconstruction deposit will be retained by the Joint Venture to be used on the park\u2019s groundwater system,\u201d which is now estimated to cost over $14 million.</p>\n<p>Taisheng argued that the contract\u2019s terms meant the deposit could only be used for work \u201cattributable to the purchaser\u201d (Taisheng) and that the city exercising its buy-back option made this impossible.</p>\n<p>Justice Underhill rejected this interpretation, calling it \u201ccommercially absurd.\u201d He found the contract\u2019s language was \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d that the money was security.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe intention of the parties, reflected in the language of the purchase agreement, is clear,\u201d the decision said. \u201cThe purpose of the transaction was to see the SIDP developed, and it was expressly structured to secure Taisheng\u2019s commitments to proceed with that development in a timely manner, failing which Terrace could repurchase the lands.\u201d</p>\n<p>The judge also dismissed Taisheng\u2019s alternative argument that keeping the deposit amounted to an \u201cunenforceable penalty.\u201d He ruled the deposit was not \u201cunconscionable\u201d or \u201cpenal,\u201d especially given the high cost of the water system.</p>\n<p>The court dismissed Taisheng\u2019s action and awarded legal costs to the City of Terrace. In their statement, the City and Kitselas First Nation acknowledged the \u201cpositive step forward\u201d but noted \u201cthere is a 30-day period in which the company may seek to appeal the ruling.\u201d</p>",
