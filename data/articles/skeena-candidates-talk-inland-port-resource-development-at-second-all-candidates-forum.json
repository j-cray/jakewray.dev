  "content_html": "<p>The three MLA candidates for the Skeena riding took part in a second all-candidates forum, hosted by the <em>Terrace Standard</em> on Wednesday, Oct. 14.</p>\n<p><strong>Watch: <a href=\"https://www.terracestandard.com/news/2020-skeena-all-candidates-forum/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2020 Skeena All Candidates Forum \u2013 Terrace</a></strong></p>\n<p>The Terrace forum was held in the <em>Terrace Standard</em> office with no members of the public present, to ensure physical distancing could be maintained. The event was live-streamed through Facebook and the <em>Terrace Standard\u2019s </em>website and was moderated by <em>Terrace Standard</em> reporter Jake Wray.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>The event was held one week after Skeena candidates participated in a similar forum in Kitimat, hosted by the Kitimat Chamber of Commerce on Oct. 7.</p>\n<p><strong>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.northernsentinel.com/news/first-all-candidates-forum-for-snap-election-held-in-kitimat/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">First All-Candidates Forum for snap election held in Kitimat</a> </strong></p>\n<p>Candidates answered questions submitted by Skeena community members, the Terrace Chamber of Commerce, CFNR News and CFTK TV News.</p>\n<p>Topics for the event included the tourism industry during and after the pandemic, diversifying the economy, youth entrepreneurship, mental health supports, and systematic racism within the RCMP to name a few.</p>\n<p>One topic that garnered a fair amount of attention was whether the candidates were for or against the inland port train trans-loading facility being proposed for Terrace.</p>\n<p>Holzbauer said that he could see both sides to the argument. However, he said he couldn\u2019t make an informed choice \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 without reading up and doing more research on the proposal.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Halbauer said she did not feel she could answer \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 to the question, as it isn\u2019t her job to make that decision, but to listen and understand and support the needs and interests of the community.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019m confident that the City of Terrace will be, you know, taking all of this information in and our city councillors \u2014 who are elected to make this decision \u2014 will make the best decision possible for all community members,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Ross, however, said he was for it, as it would help provide jobs for those in Terrace who don\u2019t want to or are unable to travel to Kitimat or Prince Rupert or elsewhere, especially in the winter.</p>\n<p>Ross added that Kitimat has the tax base from local industry and Rupert has a tax base from ships and ports. However, Terrace is often stuck in the middle, getting the influx from both other cities but not always reaping all the same benefits, and that \u201cTerrace needs something to help subsidize their tax base.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another question involved what the candidates would do to address the growing tension and conflict between Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities that both rely on fish and wildlife species for social, cultural, food usage in a way that is fair and equitable.</p>\n<p>Halbauer said the community and stakeholders need to take a look at what is actually causing the salmon depletion in the area, and come together to collaborate and look at solutions that work for everyone.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re fishing deeper, we\u2019re fishing different species, we\u2019re disrupting the food chain,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of these things need to be addressed at an international level to ensure we have salmon stocks in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ross agreed that it\u2019s an international issue, and that local stakeholders need to come together to discuss and come up with a plan, as that\u2019s often the only way governments will listen and respond to a community\u2019s issue.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve actually got three user groups: we\u2019ve got the commercial fishermen, we\u2019ve got the sport fishermen, and we\u2019ve got the First Nation fishermen,\u201d he said, \u201cand we all fight for what\u2019s left after the international fishery takes its share.\u201d</p>\n<p>Holzbauer agreed with Ross and Halbauer\u2019s statements, and said that it\u2019s important to find the common ground between those who use the resources. He acknowledged that the fishing industry was a larger resource in the past, one that has diminished over the decades, and that it\u2019s absolutely something that needs to be addressed.</p>\n<p>The event ended with the candidates\u2019 closing statements, each promising to help Skeena if elected, in their own, personal way.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf the people of Skeena choose to elect me, I will do the best to represent them \u2014 all of them \u2014 but also I think diversity in not just jobs, local economy, but also within all of us is important,\u201d Holzbauer said. \u201cAnd like I said before, it makes the world a much more interesting place to live in.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ross concluded by emphasizing his focus on resource development and the economy, as well as the need to focus on mental health supports throughout the pandemic and going forward.</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe with a strong economy we can get those good-paying jobs for our region and take care of those who need it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn conclusion, I want to ask a question back to Skeena: what do you want Skeena to be?\u201d</p>\n<p>Halbauer said, if elected, she would work in collaboration with all community members and local stakeholders to make sure the issues addressed at the event, along with the others in her and BC NDP\u2019s platform, are dealt with as promised.</p>\n<p>\u201cI spent a lot of my life having my voice silenced, and I will not be a part of doing that to anybody else,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you have an issue, you can come to me. I\u2019m here to serve. I\u2019m here to work hard for you.\u201d</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:clare.rayment@northernsentinel.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/>clare.rayment@northernsentinel.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/kitimatnews\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kitimatnews\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",
