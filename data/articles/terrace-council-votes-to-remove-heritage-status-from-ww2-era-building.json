  "content_html": "<p>In a conflicted and emotional session Oct. 14, Terrace City Council voted to adopt a bylaw removing the heritage designation from the World War II Army mess hall commonly known as the Kin Hut located near Heritage Park Museum.</p>\n<p>The decision is the final step required before the city can proceed with the demolition of the building, which has fallen into significant disrepair.</p>\n<p>The move was met with opposition from Councillor Brian Downie and frustration from members of the public.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be voting against this bylaw,\u201d Downie said. \u201cThis is the last box to be checked to enable disposition of the building.\u201d</p>\n<p>Councilors expressed their struggle with the decision, balancing the building\u2019s history against its current state and the cost of repairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point in designating buildings and sites to be of heritage value if we don\u2019t have the intention of of protecting them beyond just a designation?\u201d asked Councillor James Cordeiro. \u201cAt this point, I think it\u2019s more than likely beyond salvage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just I think this building\u2019s time has come,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Councillor Sarah Zimmerman shared this conflict.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe thing I have a hard time with is having to de-designate a heritage designation, that previous council felt was important to our community, in order to demolish the building,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in in the maintenance of it over the years, which I think falls on city council, because it was our building.\u201d</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Mayor Sean Bujtas defended past councils, citing financial constraints. \u201cIf we were Kitimat, this building would have been restored years ago because we would have\u2026 huge taxation dollars from industry,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got into this state because we\u2019ve chose things like operating a pool, a library, an arena over putting funding into this thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>During the public comment period, Brad Pretty of the Men\u2019s Shed expressed his dismay at the decision. The Terrace Men\u2019s Shed had previously offered to take over maintenance of the building.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Men\u2019s Shed would be covering it through funding,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a win for you guys, and you\u2019re throwing it away. I don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s sad. It\u2019s sad for Terrace.\u201d</p>\n<p>The council had previously discussed a staff report stating it was not feasible to enter an agreement with a third-party group to take over the building, as the city could not be absolved of liability given the unknown extent of the damage.</p>",
