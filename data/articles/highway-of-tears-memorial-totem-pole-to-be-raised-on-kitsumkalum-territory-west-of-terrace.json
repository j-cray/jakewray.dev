  "content_html": "<p>After years of planning, a commemoration and healing totem pole honouring missing and murdered Indigenous women will be raised at a highway pullout on Kitsumkalum territory west of Terrace in September.</p>\n<p>The totem pole is not just for missing and murdered Indigenous women \u2014 in a way, it\u2019s also for missing and murdered people of all ages, colours and genders, as well as for two-spirit and LGBTQ people. That\u2019s because totem poles represent fluid, metaphorical ideas and should not be interpreted in direct, concrete terms, said Mike Dangeli, the lead artist carving the totem pole.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe reading isn\u2019t necessarily \u2018this means this\u2019 or \u2018this equals this\u2019 like in the English language,\u201d he said.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Arlene Roberts, who is a key organizer of the memorial totem pole and Dangeli\u2019s mom, said the physical monument is less important than the message it sends.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to have the courage and step forward in saying \u2018No more. No more stolen sisters.\u2019 It\u2019s time to make a cultural statement, a traditional statement,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about is honouring the families, and it\u2019s treasuring the souls and spirits of the stolen sisters and boys and men, it\u2019s honouring the two-spirited LGBTQ \u2026 and they\u2019re not just First Nations. There are non-First-Nations who are going missing as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>The idea to create a memorial came from Gladys Radek, a local advocate for missing and murdered Indigenous women. After her niece Tamara Chipman disappeared near Prince Rupert in 2005, Radek started organizing awareness walks \u2014 including a walk from Vancouver to Prince Rupert, and a walk across Canada. Eventually, Radek became involved with the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls as an advisor and as an advocate for families coming forward to share stories.</p>\n<p>During all that hard work that began years ago with awareness walks, she said, she always envisioned creating a memorial for families in the Northwest.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is kind of closing the circle for me from the walks,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted a space where our families could go, to find a little bit of healing, a little bit of peace, and a little bit of honouring their loved ones.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dangeli, an artist with Nisga\u2019a, Tsimshian, Tlingit and Tsetsaut heritage, has been working on the totem pole under a tent in his back yard on Terrace\u2019s Southside since September, alongside his adult sons Michael Dangeli and Nick Dangeli. He\u2019s carved more than 20 totem poles but never one so close to home in the Northwest, he said.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>The 24-foot totem pole is is not fully carved yet, but some of the figures are starting to take shape. Dangeli pointed out the main and largest figure on the totem pole, a young woman who will have a red dress and face paint. She will represent missing and murdered indigenous women. Above her is a matriarch figure. The bottom figure, which is a crucial figure because it bears the weight of the totem pole, is a killer whale, to acknowledge that the totem pole will be on Kitsumkalum killer whale clan territory. Many other figures will adorn the totem pole when it is ready.</p>\n<p>Originally the totem pole was meant to be completed in time for a June 5 raising ceremony, but the ceremony was postponed until September because of the pandemic. That was fortunate, Dangeli said, because it allowed the artistic team to slow down their timeline and work with extra care.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause of the energy and the subject matter, it\u2019s really important that we get it done right,\u201d he said. \u201cMy sons, before we even touched it in the raw log form, I took them out on the Skeena River, and we did ritual bathing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen it was just still a log but shaped out to be a pole \u2026 We had the kids come down and sweep it with cedar boughs, and again, water from the Skeena, just to bless it and we had elders and chiefs and matriarchs come down to just get it in a good way.\u201d</p>\n<p>The raising ceremony will take place Sept. 4 and Sept. 5 in what Dangeli called a \u201cvirtual potlatch\u201d to accommodate pandemic precaution measures.</p>\n<p>The totem pole will be raised on Sept. 4, and the following day dancers, chiefs and matriarchs will breath life into the totem pole.</p>\n<p>Only a small group of people will be physically present at any given time, but the event will be live-streamed by CFNR so anyone can participate from home.</p>\n<p>The memorial totem pole project has received plenty of funding and other support, Roberts said.</p>\n<p>She is grateful to co-organizers Marc Snelling and Wanda Good, as well as Highway of Tears families, friends and walkers, the Indian Residential School Survivors Society (where she also works), Kitsumkalum chiefs and matriarchs, Women and Gender Equality Canada, and B.C.\u2019s ministry of transportation.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve just had some incredible people coming along the line and saying, \u2018What can we do? How can we help you paddle, make this journey in this canoe?\u2019\u201d Roberts said.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img alt=\"22181871_web1_200723-TST-memorial-totem-pole-crew-WEB\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/jakewray-portfolio/media/journalism/highway-of-tears-memorial-totem-pole-to-be-raised-on-kitsumkalum-territory-west-of-terrace/22181871_web1_200723-TST-memorial-totem-pole-crew-WEB.jpg\"/><figcaption>A memorial totem pole in honour of missing and murdered Indigenous women will be raised in September.
