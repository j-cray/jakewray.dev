  "content_html": "<p>Terrace RCMP will be on sharp lookout for shenanigans this May long weekend as some parks are set to reopen for day use.</p>\n<p>All provincial parks were first closed April 7 in an attempt to limit the spread of COVID-19, and some are now being reopened as part of a plan to gradually open up services and facilities, released last week by the provincial government.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the main park set to reopen in the Terrace area is Lakelse Lake Provincial Park, which was the site of significant unruly partying and underage drinking during last year\u2019s May long weekend. A young man was stabbed and another person was caught driving impaired.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cLast year was a testament to the consequences that come with a lack of adult supervision and underage drinking,\u201d said Staff Sergeant Michael Robinson in a statement provided to <em>The Terrace Standard</em>. \u201cWe had middle and high school students out at all hours of the night intoxicated by alcohol.\u201d</p>\n<p>The statement said RCMP will have extra officers on duty for May long weekend.</p>\n<p>\u201cPolice officers will be operating in a zero-tolerance capacity especially surrounding liquor offences, such as underage drinking and allowing minors to possess and consume alcohol or cannabis,\u201d the statement said.</p>\n<p>Other parks in this area that are set to reopen include Kitsumkalum Provincial Park, Hai Lake \u2013 Mount Herman Provincial Park, and Nalbeelah Creek Wetlands Provincial Park. However, Kleanza Creek Provincial Park and Exchamsiks River Provincial Park remain closed.</p>\n<p>\u201cB.C. Parks is taking a phased approach to safely lift the system closure, focusing initially on day-use parks and protected areas that can accommodate: measured use and lower environmental impacts and which can also maintain physical distancing guidelines,\u201d a release stated.</p>\n<p>Physical distancing guidelines are to give visitors space between each other in parking lots and on trails.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>The gradual openings will also mean a ramp up of services such as garbage collection and pit toilets or washrooms, depending upon a park\u2019s amenities.</p>\n<p>The May 14 re-opening also extends to trails, beaches, picnic areas and boat launches for day-use only. Provincial campgrounds won\u2019t reopen until at least June 1.</p>\n<p>The guidelines follow principles laid down by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry.</p>\n<p>When camping is allowed, depending upon facilities in each park, there may be more distance between campsites and limits as to the number of people allowed in a campground.</p>\n<p>While provincial principles encourage people to enjoy themselves outdoors, guidance remains as to limit groups to 50 people in number and to respect individual physical distancing.</p>\n<p>Visitors are being asked to bring their own hand sanitizer and people who are sick should not visit a park.</p>\n<p>And visitors are being asked to only visit parks closer to their homes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSome communal facilities such as shower buildings will open with enhanced cleaning protocols, while campgrounds that require visitors to use shared cooking facilities and backcountry cabins will remain closed,\u201d BC Parks has indicated.</p>\n<p>Parks that remain closed for the time being are those that are popular, meaning it would be difficult to adhere to physical distancing guidance.</p>\n<p>-With files from Rod Link</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",
