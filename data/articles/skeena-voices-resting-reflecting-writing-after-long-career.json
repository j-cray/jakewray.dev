  "content_html": "<p>Kitselas elder Mel Bevan, 79, has had a long, illustrious career in politics, management and community building. Now he is settling in to reflect and write about his experiences.</p>\n<p>Bevan has done plenty of work in national politics, including as a campaign co-chair for Phil Fontaine, who was National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations from 2003 to 2009. Bevan was part of the group that created Canada\u2019s First Nations Fiscal Management Act, he helped establish the Centre for First Nations Governance and he assisted with a review of land management policy at Canada\u2019s former Department of Indian Affairs.</p>\n<p>He has also done much work provincially and locally. Bevan was instrumental in the creation of Canada\u2019s First Nations Radio (CFNR) and he helped establish two legal service centres in the Northwest.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>He also served as chief negotiator for Kitselas First Nation during self-governance negotiations that lead to an agreement-in-principle between Kitselas, the provincial government and the federal government, paving the way for a formal treaty (which is still in the works).</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much more I can do, other than maybe write stuff, maybe record things that people can read,\u201d Bevan told <em>The Terrace Standard</em>.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s now working on a book that contains lessons he\u2019s learned in his decades of work with First Nations across the country, with a focus on the shortcomings of the reserve system.</p>\n<p>Bevan said that many of the projects he\u2019s worked on over the years, including the legal service centres he helped set up and an Indigenous housing program he worked on through the Kermode Friendship Society, have been changed from independent, Indigenous-led projects into provincial or federal government programs.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll the work I\u2019ve done over the years, all the things we\u2019ve managed to do, the big problem is trying to make it permanent,\u201d he said. \u201cNative people are not part of the fabric of Canada. We\u2019re outside the fabric of Canada, right, so if you get a sympathetic government you can get things like social housing or law centres, things like that, but if the government turns unsympathetic, it just disappears, and that happens to everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only thing that actually stays permanent is people on reserves that suffer from this.\u201d</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Bevan said that in his writing he also hopes to continue to record some of his knowledge of Sm\u2019algyax, his first language and the language of the Tsimshian people. The language has changed significantly since he was a boy, becoming fused with the English language, Bevan said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe old meaning is disappearing, once people like me [go,] and there\u2019s not too many of us left,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen people learn it today, they\u2019re basically speaking English.\u201d</p>\n<p>He gave the example of a Sm\u2019algyax word that today is translated to the English word \u2018chair.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201cExcept they never had chairs, all it really means a top, something to sit on. Could be a rock, or a stump, or a log, or a cedar mat,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are the meanings that have disappeared.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy point there wasn\u2019t to change what is taught now. You can\u2019t change it. I just wanted to record the old language.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sm\u2019algyax suffered a blow because of Canadian government assimilation tactics, Bevan said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey tried to beat it out of us in school, our language, wouldn\u2019t allow us to speak it. People got strapped if they spoke their language, but we always spoke it at home. My grandmother never spoke a word of English. Nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe pretended we were conforming.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bevan said he hasn\u2019t really spoken old-style Sm\u2019algyax since his mother died almost 50 years ago.</p>\n<p>In addition to writing, Bevan plans to take this summer off, to be \u201clazy,\u201d he said with a laugh.</p>\n<p>The break is well-deserved. Bevan has been working ever since he was a young man.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere was no such thing as a teenager back then,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Bevan started his working life at a local mill.</p>\n<p>\u201cMainly I worked in sawmills, I spent 10 years in Skeena Forest Products. I started out as a labourer, and ended up being a shift supervisor. I ran the mill at night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Back then it was hard for Indigenous people to find work because they were not accepted by mainstream society, Bevan said. But the late Bill McRae, who managed Skeena Sawmills for decades, would readily hire Indigenous people to work at the mill.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe grew up amongst native people. He hired all the native people, so there was a whole bunch of us that worked there, native people from all over,\u201d Bevan said. \u201cHe helped a lot of people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Working at the mill was just one way that Bevan started to build a network that would eventually lead to his later career in management and politics.</p>\n<p>Prior to working at the mill, Bevan spent a year in hospital after contracting tuberculosis, from 1956 to 1957. He was fortunate to receive treatment for his tuberculosis.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was actually lucky, if you want to call it that. The people that got it before me, say a few years before me, there was [no treatment,] so they mainly just died,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>It was an all-Indigenous hospital where he made many friends.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe reason Indian hospitals came into existence was the Province wouldn\u2019t take native people in their hospitals. They\u2019d just send them home,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>But a doctor began lobbying the Province to use Army hospitals that had been set up during the Second World War to treat Indigenous people, Bevan said. One such Army hospital was in Terrace. There, Bevan met people from Telegraph Creek to Haida Gwaii to Lake Babine.</p>\n<p>Those connections, and many others he made along the way, propelled him toward the national stage, Bevan said.</p>\n<p>In retrospect, Bevan said, there is at least one key point he learned in all his work and travels: Indigenous people do not want to be assimilated.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe most important thing to everybody, all across the country, is to stay who they are,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Haida, they don\u2019t want to be anything but Haida. The Nisga\u2019a, they don\u2019t want to be anything but Nisga\u2019a.\u201d</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",
