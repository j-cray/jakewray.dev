Seemingly all towns along that section of Highway 16 were affected. Stewart, the Nass Valley, areas near Fort St. James, and parts of Haida Gwaii also lost power, according to BC Hydro\u2019s outage map. Approximately 45,000 BC Hydro customers were affected, according to a BC Hydro spokesperson. Power was brought back online in stages, community by community, east to west, the spokesperson said. \u201cPower has been restored to about 96 per cent of customers, and had to be restored in stages to maintain voltage stability and protect the grid from further disruptions,\u201d the spokesperson said in an email. \u201cWe thank customers for their patience.\u201d The lighting strike was near BC Hydro\u2019s transmission line that conducts electricity along the highway corridor, which lead to the large-scale outage.
