He nicknamed the expanded operation \u201cCOVID Gardens.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shaw said municipal government policies can be used to strengthen local food production.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe decisions and things that you can enable can make huge, huge differences,\u201d he told Terrace council.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Municipalities can make public land available for farming, establish municipal composting services, make room for agriculture in urban land use policies, and prioritize food security and local food production in municipal economic development plans, Shaw said.</p>\n<p>Shaw provided council with a 14-page document detailing his policy proposals, a document he created as part of his role advising the City of Prince Rupert in its Sustainable City 2030 initiative.
