  "content_html": "<p>MLA Ellis Ross rode his bike from Terrace to Kitimat on Sept. 16 to raise cancer awareness.</p>\n<p>He had planned to participate in the Cops for Cancer relay bike ride from Prince Rupert to Terrace, covering the final 13km of the route. However, physical Cops for Cancer rides across the country have been cancelled last minute or shifted to a virtual format following an uptick in COVID-19 cases in several provinces, according to the Canadian Cancer Society, which organizes the relay.</p>\n<p>Ross had already ridden his bike from Kitimat to Terrace in preparation for the relay (a gruelling journey that took about two hours 40 minutes, he said) and he wasn\u2019t about to give up, so he decided to turn around and do the roughly 60 km ride again the other way.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>He said he was inspired by the many social media messages he received from people who shared their stories of how cancer touched their lives. This year, the ride carried even more significance, Ross said, because his mother was diagnosed with cancer several months ago and is battling the illness in Prince George.</p>\n<p>\u201cI got extra motivation,\u201d Ross said. \u201cIt\u2019s got a personal meaning for me this time around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Upon completing the ride back to Kitimat, Ross said he was exhausted but the ride was more than worth it. He said he would like to do the ride again next year but it would be better if he had some riding partners. He thanked everyone who honked, waved or yelled to show support.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img alt=\"22726771_web1_200924-TST-ellis-ross-ride-photos_5\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/jakewray-portfolio/media/journalism/mla-to-ride-bike-from-terrace-to-kitimat/22726771_web1_200924-TST-ellis-ross-ride-photos_5.jpg\"/><figcaption>Skeena MLA Ellis Ross at the Kitimat snowflake welcome sign, passed out on the grass, exhausted from his hard ride from Terrace.
