Probably 350 lbs. to 400 lbs.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spirit bears, also known as Kermode bears, are black bears with white fur resulting from a rare genetic mutation. They are primarily found in northern B.C.</p>\n<p>Because Spirit bears are rare, conservation officers are far more likely to relocate them instead of killing them when they become too close to humans.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cWhen we catch them, we immobilize them, we look at them, make sure they\u2019re in good shape, there\u2019s no injuries, there\u2019s no abscessed teeth or anything like that, and if they\u2019re a candidate for being moved \u2026 that\u2019s what we do,\u201d Walbauer said. \u201cEspecially with Kermodes. We don\u2019t do that with black bears. Conflict black bears we typically dispatch.\u201d</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",
