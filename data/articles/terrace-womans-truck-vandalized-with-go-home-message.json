  "content_html": "<p>A Terrace woman with a University of Washington decal on her truck says a vandal wrote a note on the truck telling her to go home.</p>\n<p>Janine Kraft, manager of the local Tim Hortons, said she has lived in Terrace since 2003 and attended the University of Washington via distance learning, graduating in 2009. She noticed the vandalism, which she believes was written using some type of hand lotion, just above the license plate on the tailgate of her truck as she returned home from work May 27.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt said \u2018go home, borders closed, you\u2019re not welcome,\u2019\u201d she told <em>The Terrace Standard</em>. \u201cI was really hurt \u2026 That feeling of violation, knowing somebody touched your vehicle, was very uncomfortable for me.\u201d</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>It\u2019s baffling, Kraft said, that the vandal focused on the university decal while ignoring her B.C. plates, MacCarthy GM plate brackets, and a Calgary Flames air freshener hanging up front.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s got very clearly some Canadian parts to it. I couldn\u2019t believe that somebody would just focus on the decal, and not look a little further before they took the time to deface my property,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Kraft said she did not take a picture of the vandalism because she wasn\u2019t sure what material was used to write it and she was concerned about damage to the paint.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know how long it was there, so my first instinct was not to take a picture, my first instinct was to get it the heck off my truck,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>She said she feels lucky her truck was only vandalized with cream, unlike some similar recent cases she has read about.</p>\n<p>\u201cThose guys got keyed, and even their notes were mean. Mine was at least [relatively] polite,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI knew I was dealing with an adult when they spelled \u2018you\u2019re\u2019 \u2026 with the apostrophe.\u201d</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Overall, Kraft said she expects better of her community.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are people, not license plates \u2026 There\u2019s a variety of reasons people could be here, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean non-essential travel,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was very disappointing and I think Terrace can do better.\u201d</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",
