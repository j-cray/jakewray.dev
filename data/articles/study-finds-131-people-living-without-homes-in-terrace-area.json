  "content_html": "<p>The number of people counted as experiencing homelessness in Terrace has dropped since the last provincial survey in 2023, but advocates caution the latest figures only capture a snapshot of a complex issue.</p>\n<p>According to a report on the 2025 Point-in-Time Homeless Count, held April 25, 131 people were identified as homeless in Terrace. That\u2019s down from 156 people recorded in 2023. Of those surveyed this year, 74 were sheltered while 57 were unsheltered.</p>\n<p>Indigenous people continue to be overrepresented among Terrace\u2019s homeless population. Sixty-one per cent of respondents identified as Indigenous, compared to about 22 per cent of Terrace\u2019s overall population. The report notes that systemic racism, intergenerational trauma, and barriers to accessing services contribute to these disproportionate rates.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>The survey found that 81 per cent of respondents reported being homeless for more than a year, and two-thirds had been without housing for five years or longer. Nearly half said they first experienced homelessness as youth, and 52 per cent had been in foster care or a group home. Respondents reported high rates of health issues, including mental illness, substance use challenges, physical disabilities, and acquired brain injuries. Many faced overlapping conditions.</p>\n<p>Substance use was very common. The most frequently reported substances were nicotine, alcohol, stimulants, cannabis and opiates. The leading reasons for losing housing included not enough income, conflict with a spouse or partner, abuse, and substance use. Nine per cent said their most recent housing loss was due to an eviction.</p>\n<p>Income insecurity was another defining factor. The majority of those surveyed relied on social assistance income or disability assistance, and just eight per cent reported regular employment.</p>\n<p>The report stresses that Point-in-Time counts represent a minimum estimate, as they only measure a single 24-hour period. By focusing on a single day, a count will not include some people who cycle in and out of homelessness, and the methodology almost certainly under-counts the true extent of homelessness in Terrace.</p>\n<p>This was the second provincial homeless count held in Terrace, following the first in 2023. Local coordination for the 2025 survey was led by the \u2018Ksan Society with support from community volunteers and people with lived experience of homelessness.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div>",
