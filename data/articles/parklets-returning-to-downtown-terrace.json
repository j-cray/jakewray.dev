  "content_html": "<p>The City of Terrace is inviting local businesses to construct parklets \u2014 portable patios that can be placed in roadside parking spaces.</p>\n<p>A pilot project last summer saw a City-owned parklet installed in front of Bert\u2019s Delicatessen on Park Ave. Now, the City is seeking applicants interested in hosting the City\u2019s parklet in front of a business, as well as applicants interested in constructing their own.</p>\n<p>Jack Cherniawsky, a city planner, said parklet applications are being reviewed on a case-by-case basis to ensure the parklets aren\u2019t placed too close together, are sturdy and leave sufficient parking in a given area.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cWe want to ensure it\u2019s safe, durable and can\u2019t be moved easily or subjected to vandalism,\u201d he said, noting the pilot project parklet last year did not face any vandalism.</p>\n<p>The City is not directly assessing aesthetic elements of parklet designs. Cherniawsky said he\u2019s seen fantastic parklet designs in various other cities and regions.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s some pretty great designs that would be awesome to see in the city of Terrace,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Parklet hosts will be responsible for any movable elements such as chairs and tables. Hosts will also be responsible for ensuring physical-distancing measures are followed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis summer is obviously going to be unusual for the [parklet] program with physical distancing requirements related to COVID-19,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the City\u2019s efforts to create an attractive and thriving downtown are based on much longer timelines. We hope to see parklets and other seasonal programming in the downtown for years to come. \u201c</p>\n<p>Cherniawsky said the City\u2019s parklet is modular and can be configured in a small format or a large format, and it\u2019s likely the large format would be used this year as it is more conducive to physical distancing. Plus, he said, the parklets could help with physical distancing in some scenarios.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cPotentially it could be a good way to provide additional waiting spaces for businesses, to accommodate physical-distancing,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Richard Kriegl, owner of Bert\u2019s Deli, said last year he was originally concerned the parklet would take up a parking space for his business but now likes the idea after seeing it being well-used.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a cool idea. It gets people out and it has a more European vibe to it,\u201d Kriegl said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s so happy to see this.\u201d</p>\n<p>-With files from Brittany Gervais</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",
