Organizers said the rally was also to raise awareness for missing and murdered Indigenous women. Some demonstrators held signs bearing the name of Chantel Moore, a 26-year-old Indigenous woman from Vancouver Island who was shot and killed by police in New Brunswick on June 4 after moving there to be closer to her five-year-old daughter.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chants including \u201cno justice, no peace,\u201d and \u201cblack lives matter\u201d were punctuated by heavy gusts of wind, though it was clear and sunny. Plenty of demonstrators wore medical masks and some wore gloves. Many cars driving past on Eby St. honked, with some drivers and passengers giving thumbs-up to indicate support.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A handful of demonstrators took up a megaphone to share stories and messages with the crowd.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mina Lwal told the crowd she had faced racism at school in Kitimat.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThey referred to me as \u2018the ugly black girl.\u2019 \u2026 Every time I walked down the hall, I\u2019d hear them whispering, or behind my back in group chats they\u2019d talk about it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know what, I\u2019m owning it today. I\u2019m not an ugly black girl, I\u2019m for sure a beautiful South-Sudanese woman living in Canada today, in front of all of you.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lwal asked the crowd to be as loud as they possibly could for all the chants that day.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThis movement is not going anywhere, and we, as a people, are not going anywhere because we\u2019re strong,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are all one race, and that\u2019s the human race, and we all deserve to get treated as equal because at the end of the day, I bleed the same as you do, and I cry the same as you do.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amber Webb, who is black, shared with the crowd some words written by her father.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cA group of National Guard members went down on one knee in solidarity \u2026 This is what we need, rather than the hatred and violence spewing out of the White House which poisons the US, Canada, and the world,\u201d she said. \u201cOur government, cowering inside our houses of Parliament, lacking the courage to stand up to a bully or call a lie a lie, is not anything to admire.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Webb\u2019s father\u2019s words also touched upon economic inequality.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cAt the heart of all of this, our countries have become quasi-democracies, where the real power lies within the wealthiest ten per cent. If we do not serve them, they will hurt us,\u201d she said to the crowd. \u201cSurely we will look at the bullying power and luxurious life of the few, beside the poverty, suffering and powerlessness and ask \u2018can we allow this modern form of slavery to continue?\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There were some criticisms of the rally voiced in the comments of a post in the Terrace Community Bulletin Board on Facebook (though most comments were supportive.)</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI absolutely think there should be non-violent protests, but not for this. There is significantly more black-on-black crime and no one bats an eye. Where are your protests when that happens?\u201d wrote Brittany Joyce. \u201cWhat are you accomplishing?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One commenter raised safety concerns regarding the pandemic.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI hope folks are maintaining proper social distancing,\u201d wrote Warren Wilson.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the organizers of the event, Shea Kurisu, acknowledged the risk of gathering a crowd during this pandemic but said the rally was essential work. Organizers handed out free masks to demonstrators. Ultimately, Kurisu said, demonstrators were each responsible for their own safety.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kurisu said she organized the event because her husband and two children are people of colour.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI see the injustices that people of colour live with every single day, and I wanted to use my white privilege and my voice to raise the voices of those that aren\u2019t being heard,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jillian Kofoed, who organized the event alongside Kurisu, said she organized the event because she hasn\u2019t done enough to stand up to racism.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cSilence is compliance. I am not a racist, but I never said anything against racism,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to educate ourselves about all of it, we\u2019re not perfect, we\u2019ve still got a lot to learn. That\u2019s part of the reason why we\u2019re doing this today is because we needed to hear the voices of the people that this affects first-hand.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.terracestandard.com/news/anti-racism-demonstration-held-in-terrace/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Terrace Standard.</a></p>\n </div>",
