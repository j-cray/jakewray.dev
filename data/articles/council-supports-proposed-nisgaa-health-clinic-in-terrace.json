  "content_html": "<p>Terrace city council has thrown its support behind a grant application to establish a permanent, stationary medical outreach clinic in Terrace, though the move sparked debate over where such a facility might be located.</p>\n<p>At its Nov. 10 meeting, council reviewed a request from Raina Trappl, medical outreach clinic manager for the Nisga\u2019a Valley Health Authority. </p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>NVHA is applying for funding through Health Canada\u2019s Emergency Treatment Fund to establish outreach clinic services at a fixed storefront location.</p>\n<p>According to the request, the new stationary clinic is being developed in partnership with the Coast Mountain Primary Care Network. It aims to provide low-barrier, multidisciplinary care to the community\u2019s most vulnerable \u2014 specifically those facing substance use challenges, mental health concerns, and housing instability.</p>\n<p>\u201cBuilding on our previous outreach work with the medical outreach clinic van\u2026 our primary care services will include opioid agonist treatment, wound care, cancer screening, harm reduction supports, and culturally safe system navigation,\u201d Trappl wrote in her request to council.</p>\n<p>While the request for a letter of support was ultimately successful, it drew scrutiny from Councillor James Cordeiro. </p>\n<p>He raised concerns about the shift from a dispersed mobile model to a fixed location, noting the potential for unintended consequences in the surrounding neighbourhood.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe reality is they do tend to have a negative impact on the immediate proximity to the facility,\u201d Cordeiro argued. He questioned if a proposed location had been identified, to which staff replied it had not.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Cordeiro cautioned that while the services are needed, a fixed low-barrier site can \u201cconcentrate\u201d social issues. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe service provider doesn\u2019t really have a responsibility after [clients] leave the area\u2026 but there is an impact that is created by concentrating those services,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Councillor Brian Downie pushed back against the concerns, citing the success of the current mobile unit. \u201cI see none of the examples that you\u2019re referring to,\u201d Downie said, praising the doctor, nurse, and social worker currently delivering care on the street. \u201cIt\u2019s just a very effective service for people that will not go into an institution.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mayor Sean Bujtas acknowledged Cordeiro\u2019s points regarding neighbourhood impacts but argued that securing the funding and services should be the priority. He suggested that zoning and location issues could be addressed if and when the project moves forward.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese are things that we really need,\u201d Bujtas said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that this is going to have a negative impact, but there\u2019s always that concern.\u201d</p>\n<p>Council voted to provide the letter of support for the grant application to Health Canada.</p>",
