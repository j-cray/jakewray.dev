I\u2019m friends with the owners there, and we were having a cold beer one evening,\u201d said organizer Jay Wiebe. \u201cI had blown up my lawn mower, and I decided I was going to put a quad engine in my lawn mower, and the owner of Moosehorn just popped up the idea, \u2018Well, why don\u2019t we start a lawn mower race thing?\u2019\u201d From that spur-of-the-moment idea, a fullscale community event was born. The race will be held the Saturday before Father\u2019s Day to allow participants to spend the holiday itself with family. The event is shaping up to be more than just a race. \u201cWe\u2019ve got quite the venue,\u201d Wiebe said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a live band, the local live band Dead Horse Hill will be playing, and I might be adding another one to that list. We\u2019ve got a food truck coming out, Grumpy Gal Grub, and we also have a couple of the local businesses like Tatalrose [Corner] Store and Takysie Resort. They are going to have booths there as well with some of their swag and snacks.\u201d Safety is a priority. \u201cThere will be no blades allowed,\u201d said Wiebe.
