  "content_html": "<p>Young soccer players yearning for the field during the pandemic now have a new way to get involved with the sport.</p>\n<p>The Terrace Youth Soccer Association (TYSA) is making several web resources available free to all its members, including a live webcast video training session each Tuesday from 4:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. beginning May 12.</p>\n<p>The core idea is that each training session will feature a coach demonstrating an exercise or skill, with kids encouraged to follow along at home. But Adam Glass, TYSA technical director, said the biggest challenge will be keeping kids engaged in the lessons.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cIt can be very difficult for a kid to stay engaged, face-to-face across the screen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s different when you\u2019re in person.\u201d</p>\n<p>Glass said kids need a variety of content in order to remain interested. He\u2019ll be the main coach, but later sessions could feature different coaches with different skill sets.</p>\n<p>TYSA has an official partnership with the Vancouver Whitecaps Football Club (VWFC,) which might mean VWFC players could make guest appearances in future webcasts.</p>\n<p>The sessions might include a light homework component, such as a juggling challenge where players would aim to juggle a soccer ball as long as they could, each week striving to beat their own record from the previous week.</p>\n<p>The main goal of the webcasts, Glass said, is to provide an outlet for the energy youth players normally pour into the sport.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy the start of May, most kids in this area know \u2018hey, it\u2019s soccer time,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cPrimarily the priority is to make sure those players are engaged.\u201d</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>The organization is assessing the long-term viability of web training sessions to bolster training after the pandemic passes, Glass said.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy using the online sessions, it might be a really good opportunity for us to engage with players that can\u2019t always make it to the field, for whatever reason,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Glass said he\u2019s had a chance to talk about this season with some TYSA players through his role as a VWFC academy coach.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re upbeat and they\u2019re positive, they\u2019re happy that they\u2019re able to connect,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking forward to when they do go back on the field.\u201d</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",
