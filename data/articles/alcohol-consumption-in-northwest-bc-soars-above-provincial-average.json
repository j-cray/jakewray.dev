  "content_html": "<p>People in Northwest B.C. purchase\u00a0more alcohol than any other region of the province, according to recent data released by the University of Victoria.</p>\n<p>The provincial average amount of alcohol purchased\u00a0in a year is at a 20-year low. The data is presented in litres of absolute alcohol per person over the age of 15, with 1 litre of absolute alcohol being equivalent to approximately 58.65 standard drinks.\u00a0British Columbians purchased an approximate average of\u00a08.17 litres of absolute alcohol in 2023, down from 8.45\u00a0litres in 2003\u2014although the amount purchased did rise and fall\u00a0over the 20-year period, peaking at 9.41 litres in 2020.</p>\n<p>But in the Northwest, alcohol sales increased steadily from\u00a09.51\u00a0litres of absolute alcohol per year in 2003 to 13.4 litres in 2023, peaking at 13.7 litres in 2022. This puts the Northwest as the heaviest-drinking region in the province, with the next closest region being East Kootenay\u00a0at 13.38 litres in 2023. Both the Northwest and East Kootenay drank significantly more than the region third highest on the list, North Vancouver Island, which drank 12.24 litres in 2023, while the lowest region, Fraser North, drank only 5.49 litres of absolute alcohol per person in 2023.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>The data was\u00a0released by\u00a0<meta charset=\"utf-8\"/>University of Victoria\u2019s Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research (CISUR), which in a press release linked\u00a0the lowering rate of drinking to a cultural shift as immigrants arrive from countries that drink less than Canada.</p>\n<p>\"One potential factor is that BC has seen significant population increases over the last few years. Paired with moderate decreases in overall alcohol sales, this has led to lower sales per capita, since new arrivals may drink less,\u00a0particularly those coming from countries with lower consumption than Canada,\" the press release said.\u00a0\"Other factors may be increases in inflation and general costs of living have led to people spending less on alcohol.\"</p>\n<p><em>Black Press Media\u00a0</em>reached out to Northern Health as well as academic experts\u00a0to determine why the Northwest might be purchasing\u00a0more alcohol that other areas of the province, but\u00a0none were willing to comment.</p>\n<p>The CISUR press release said even the provincial average still indicates an unhealthy level of drinking in B.C.</p>\n<p>\"Despite the steep and continued decline, British Columbians still consume an average of nine standard drinks per week, which is about 50% more alcohol than suggested by Canada\u2019s Guidance on Alcohol and Health,\" the press release said. \"It is also above the Canadian average of eight standard drinks per week.\"</p>\n<p>The Canadian average is also falling, according to the CISUR press release, as their data matches a downward trend noted by Statistics Canada.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div>",
