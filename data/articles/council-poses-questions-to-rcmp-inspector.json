  "content_html": "<p>The number of files handled by Terrace RCMP plunged temporarily mid-March but has now essentially returned to normal, Inspector Jayson Lucash told Terrace city council.</p>\n<p>The Inspector appeared before council May 11 for a routine annual meeting to determine the Terrace RCMP detachment\u2019s priorities for the next year. Council had little to say on the matter, opting to simply carry forward priorities set last year, which include increased visible RCMP presence in the downtown core, more traffic enforcement, working more closely with community agencies on matters of addiction and domestic violence, and respectful workplace training for RCMP members. </p>\n<p>But council did have several general questions for the Inspector.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Mayor Carol Leclerc asked if the detachment\u2019s workload was affected by the pandemic. Lucash said the detachment\u2019s workload was unusually light in mid-March, around the time COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic, but the number of files being handled now is just two per cent lower than this time last year.</p>\n<p>\u201cMid-March was down substantially, the amount of volume there, which in a way was a blessing because it gave a lot of the [Terrace RCMP] members an opportunity to catch up on their paperwork,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>And, he added, the number of files forwarded to crown prosecutors, in the expectation of charges being laid, is up six per cent compared to this time last year.</p>\n<p>Lucash said the detachment received a number of calls that were COVID-19 \u201ctattle-taling,\u201d where people were, for example, phoning to report their neighbours for not maintaining social distancing.</p>\n<p>Councillor Brian Downie asked for an update on enforcement of drug trafficking. Lucash said the detachment\u2019s investigative unit spent much of last year working on top-priority investigations including a homicide.</p>\n<p>When they finished the majority of the work on those files, the investigative unit then had time to focus on a drug trafficking investigation which lead to a serious drug bust and arrests at a house on Scott Ave.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>The investigative unit continues to pursue drug trafficking, Lucash said, but they may have to shift their focus if another serious event such as a homicide happens.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey do have several other targets in mind. There are other investigations that are ongoing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut sometimes they do get pushed to the side when other events take place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Councillor James Cordeiro said there is a small group of repeat offenders who shoplift in town, and asked Lucash what is being done to solve that issue.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt does seem to me that it is a small group of prolific offenders that are just constantly popping up and shoplifting and causing other issues,\u201d Cordeiro said. \u201cI\u2019m just curious what the strategy is for dealing with these prolific offenders, because there doesn\u2019t seem to be much that has been effective in dealing with them, or any way of deterring them from re-offending.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lucash said judges are extremely hesitant, during the pandemic, to send convicted offenders to correctional facilities.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo we are getting a lot of prolific individuals, who we are targeting, who are getting successful convictions on, but who are being almost immediately returned to the community,\u201d he said. \u201cI am hoping that will change as the pandemic kind of runs its course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Lucash said, the RCMP keeps a close eye on repeat offenders.</p>\n<p>\u201c[We] know who those individuals are,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not afforded any breaks.\u201d</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",
