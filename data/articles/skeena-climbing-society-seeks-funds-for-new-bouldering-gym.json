  "content_html": "<p>The Skeena Climbing Society is proposing a new bouldering gym to be installed within the Terrace Peaks Gymnastics Club facility, aiming to fill a significant recreational gap in the city.</p>\n<p>Gail Febo, presenting for the society, told Terrace city council at a meeting Oct. 14 that the project aims to address the high demand for climbing, which is currently underserved by the limited public access at the Caledonia Secondary School gym.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have just eight months a year. We can use it two hours a week, and within those two hours, it\u2019s quite crowded,\u201d Febo said.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>She noted that a kids\u2019 climb event the society held highlighted the need for more than just a training facility.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was actually a desire for a positive social space in the winter time,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lack in Terrace of places you can go, and especially drop-in spaces\u2026 that are affordable.\u201d</p>\n<p>The project, which requires $130,000 in fundraising, would also create the first climbing competition center north of Kelowna.</p>\n<p>\u201cTerrace is by far the largest center in BC without public access to a climbing gym,\u201d Febo said.</p>\n<p>Council was supportive of the project, with Councillor Sarah Zimmerman confirming the demand she saw at the kids\u2019 event.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can attest that there were long lineup,\u201d she said. \u201cI can see that the demand is there.\u201d</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Council voted to provide a letter of support for a grant application, but with a condition suggested by Councillor James Cordeiro that the project first receive endorsement from the Regional District of Kitimat-Stikine, as the facility is located in Thornhill, outside city limits.</p>",
