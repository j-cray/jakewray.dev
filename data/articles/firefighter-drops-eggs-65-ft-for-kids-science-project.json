  "content_html": "<p>A small group of teachers and firefighters gathered May 21 to drop eggs from a 65 ft. fire engine ladder \u2014 all in the name of science.</p>\n<p>It was the annual Cassie Hall Elementary School egg drop contest. Students were tasked with packaging their egg in a box, using their choice of materials for shielding. Eggs that survive the drop are winners.</p>\n<p>Normally the egg drop is held at the elementary school with hundreds of students participating, but this year the event was held out at the Thornhill fire hall with no students present, to ensure physical distancing. It was billed as a \u201cvirtual touchless\u201d egg drop. Only 11 students submitted eggs this year.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cThis year it was hard to get kids motivated to do it,\u201d said Nancy Jay, a grade 4 teacher, adding that keeping students engaged has generally been a challenge this year as students have been out of school since spring break due to the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, she said, it was still important to hold the event. Amanda Shore, a grade 2 teacher, echoed that sentiment.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think a lot of the kids just really want to be back at school, and they miss their friends, and it\u2019s been a really hard time for them,\u201d Shore said. \u201cDoing something educational that\u2019s fun too \u2026 is an uplifting thing for them.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Adam Teichroeb, a Thornhill volunteer firefighter, was the one who went up in the ladder bucket to drop the eggs.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy only real challenge is to try and throw them all exactly the same, so that nobody has an advantage,\u201d he said.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>The egg drop also provides an opportunity to practice safety protocols and use of the ladder truck, Teichroeb said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have my full harness that I have to use \u2026 I have to know where to connect it to,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t doing it today, but I could control everywhere I go from up in the basket.\u201d</p>\n<p>Teichroeb had some advice for kids who will participate in the challenge next year.</p>\n<p>\u201cThink light. The lighter, the better,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Jay said egg drops were a regular fixture at district science fairs years ago, but those science fairs no longer take place, so she decided to bring the egg drop to Cassie Hall Elementary school.</p>\n<p>Shore and Jay both said they assumed the egg drop wouldn\u2019t happen this year because of physical distancing, but Peggy Gilliard, a Thornhill volunteer firefighter, saw the egg drop come up in her calender and she suggested pushing forward with the event.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the firefighting thing, [we] always say \u2018adapt and overcome,\u2019\u201d Gilliard said.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",
