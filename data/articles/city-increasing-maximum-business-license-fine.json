  "content_html": "<p>The City of Terrace is proposing to increase the maximum fine for violating business licence regulations to $10,000, up from $2,000.</p>\n<p>The increase is one of several amendments to the City\u2019s business licence bylaw proposed at a council meeting May 25. It\u2019s merely an administrative change to an upper limit that will likely never be reached, according to David Block, director of development services.</p>\n<p>Bylaw officers can issue tickets up to $500 as outlined in the City\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.terrace.ca/sites/default/files/docs/city-hall/bylaws/1827-05_con_oct_2019.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ticket Information Utilization</a> bylaw, which lists possible bylaw infractions and corresponding fines. For example, riding horses downtown carries a $100 fine.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>If a perpetrator continually ignores fines, they can be taken to court, which is when penalties over $500 would apply.</p>\n<p>\u201c[That] would be probably step five or six down the line, there would be tickets issued first,\u201d Block said, providing a hypothetical example of when the maximum fine might apply. \u201cIf a business licence was revoked and a business continued to operate, that\u2019s when we might hit them with a $10,000 fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>The City tries to avoid letting situations deteriorate to the point they must go to court, Block said.</p>\n<p>\u201cEven the day before, we\u2019ve pulled court dates because we\u2019ve met with individuals and they\u2019ve made some progress, finally, on the issue,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Block said he wasn\u2019t certain what the highest fine actually issued by the City was.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe may, in times, have issued a business or an individual, whatever the case may be, fines up in the $500 to $800 range, through two or three tickets issued concurrently,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably about the maximum.\u201d</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>The City\u2019s business licence bylaw is the only bylaw that does not yet have a maximum penalty of $10,000, Block said, so city staff are proposing to change it for consistency.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis bylaw hasn\u2019t been amended on that item since it was written back in probably the \u201890s, and it had that maximum $2,000 limit for whatever reason at the time, so we just brought the bylaw into line with everything else,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>$10,000 was for a long time the maximum fine municipalities were authorized for by the Community Charter \u2014 provincial legislation that governs municipalities. The Community Charter was recently amended to allow for $50,000 fines, but Block said City staff didn\u2019t think that necessary for Terrace.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t go all the way to the $50,000 that we\u2019re allowed to and the main reason is that we\u2019ve never issued a fine to the maximum $10,000, ever, I think, on the City\u2019s record books,\u201d he said.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",
