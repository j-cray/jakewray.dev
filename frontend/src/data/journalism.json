    "content_html": "<p>Six million dollars are once again on the line for Terrace and Kitselas First Nation.</p>\n<p>Taisheng International Investment Services, the former developer of the Skeena Industrial Development Park (SIDP), is appealing a court decision from October 2025 that saw a joint venture between the City of Terrace and Kitselas First Nation keep a $6 million construction deposit from Taisheng after the developer did not build a groundwater system at the SIDP.</p>\n<p>Court documents obtained by <em>The Terrace Standard</em> show that an appeal was filed in November 2025 but do not list an argument for the appeal. Representatives of Taisheng Internatioal Investment Services did not respond to request for comment by press deadline.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>A spokesperson for the City of Terrace confirmed the City is still in litigation for the $6 million, and said that the City is currently lobbying higher levels of government for money to get the groundwater system built at the SIDP.</p>\n<p>\u201cBased on Taisheng incomplete drawings it is believed very rough (no quotes involved yet) $32 million dollar cost to get water in the park,\u201d the spokesperson said in an email. \u201cHence, we are in the process of lobbying the government for a package of money that won\u2019t set Terrace back even further.\u201d</p>\n<p>The decision in October dismissed a lawsuit from Taisheng International Investment Services seeking to recover the $6 million deposit. The judge, Justice Underhill, stated that Taisheng was not entitled to the return of the deposit after it failed to meet contractual deadlines, which ultimately led the City of Terrace to repurchase the lands.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo find otherwise,\u201d the justice wrote, \u201cwould result in Taisheng receiving a $6.18 million windfall.\u201d</p>\n<p>The case originates from a 2014 agreement where Taisheng agreed to purchase 1,187 acres of land from the city for $11.878 million. The contract required Taisheng to develop the lands into an industrial park, which included constructing a road and a groundwater system.</p>\n<p>Under the agreement, Taisheng was eligible for reimbursements for this infrastructure work if it met specific deadlines. The city agreed to reimburse Taisheng approximately $6.18 million for the construction of the groundwater system.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>By 2019, with the system still not built, the parties executed an amendment to their contract. In a transaction that occurred on June 28, 2019, the City of Terrace paid Taisheng the $6,183,686.80 \u201cgroundwater reimbursement.\u201d On the same day, Taisheng paid the exact same amount back to the city, where it was held as a \u201cconstruction deposit\u201d to be used as security for the completion of the water system.</p>\n<p>According to the court decision, Taisheng failed to meet the construction milestones set out in the development plan. As a result, the City of Terrace exercised its option to purchase the land back on Oct. 15, 2021, a move that was validated in a separate arbitration proceeding. The lands were officially transferred back to the city on Oct. 4, 2023.</p>\n<p>A day later, Taisheng demanded the return of its $6.18 million deposit, arguing that since the city now owned the land, it could not use the deposit for its intended purpose. In a joint statement, the City of Terrace and Kitselas First Nation confirmed the \u201cconstruction deposit will be retained by the Joint Venture to be used on the park\u2019s groundwater system,\u201d which is now estimated to cost over $14 million.</p>\n<p>Taisheng argued that the contract\u2019s terms meant the deposit could only be used for work \u201cattributable to the purchaser\u201d (Taisheng) and that the city exercising its buy-back option made this impossible. Justice Underhill rejected this interpretation, calling it \u201ccommercially absurd.\u201d He found the contract\u2019s language was \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d that the money was security.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe intention of the parties, reflected in the language of the purchase agreement, is clear,\u201d the decision said. \u201cThe purpose of the transaction was to see the SIDP developed, and it was expressly structured to secure Taisheng\u2019s commitments to proceed with that development in a timely manner, failing which Terrace could repurchase the lands.\u201d</p>\n<p>The judge also dismissed Taisheng\u2019s alternative argument that keeping the deposit amounted to an \u201cunenforceable penalty.\u201d He ruled the deposit was not \u201cunconscionable\u201d or \u201cpenal,\u201d especially given the high cost of the water system.</p>\n<p><em>\u2014With files from Rod Link</em></p>",

The judge stated that Taisheng was not entitled to the return of the deposit after it failed to meet contractual deadlines, which ultimately led the City of Terrace to repurchase the lands.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cTo find otherwise,\u201d the justice wrote, \u201cwould result in Taisheng receiving a $6.18 million windfall.\u201d</p>\n<p>The case originates from a 2014 agreement where Taisheng agreed to purchase 1,187 acres of land from the city for $11.878 million. The contract required Taisheng to develop the lands into an industrial park, which included constructing a road and a groundwater system.</p>\n<p>Under the agreement, Taisheng was eligible for reimbursements for this infrastructure work if it met specific deadlines. The city agreed to reimburse Taisheng approximately $6.18 million for the construction of the groundwater system.</p>\n<p>By 2019, with the system still not built, the parties executed an amendment to their contract. In a transaction that occurred on June 28, 2019, the City of Terrace paid Taisheng the $6,183,686.80 \u201cgroundwater reimbursement.\u201d On the same day, Taisheng paid the exact same amount back to the city, where it was held as a \u201cconstruction deposit\u201d to be used as security for the completion of the water system.</p>\n<p>According to the court decision, Taisheng failed to meet the construction milestones set out in the development plan. As a result, the City of Terrace exercised its option to purchase the land back on Oct. 15, 2021, a move that was validated in a separate arbitration proceeding. The lands were officially transferred back to the city on Oct. 4, 2023.</p>\n<p>A day later, Taisheng demanded the return of its $6.18 million deposit, arguing that since the city now owned the land, it could not use the deposit for its intended purpose.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>In a joint statement, the City of Terrace and Kitselas First Nation confirmed the \u201cconstruction deposit will be retained by the Joint Venture to be used on the park\u2019s groundwater system,\u201d which is now estimated to cost over $14 million.</p>\n<p>Taisheng argued that the contract\u2019s terms meant the deposit could only be used for work \u201cattributable to the purchaser\u201d (Taisheng) and that the city exercising its buy-back option made this impossible.</p>\n<p>Justice Underhill rejected this interpretation, calling it \u201ccommercially absurd.\u201d He found the contract\u2019s language was \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d that the money was security.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe intention of the parties, reflected in the language of the purchase agreement, is clear,\u201d the decision said. \u201cThe purpose of the transaction was to see the SIDP developed, and it was expressly structured to secure Taisheng\u2019s commitments to proceed with that development in a timely manner, failing which Terrace could repurchase the lands.\u201d</p>\n<p>The judge also dismissed Taisheng\u2019s alternative argument that keeping the deposit amounted to an \u201cunenforceable penalty.\u201d He ruled the deposit was not \u201cunconscionable\u201d or \u201cpenal,\u201d especially given the high cost of the water system.</p>\n<p>The court dismissed Taisheng\u2019s action and awarded legal costs to the City of Terrace. In their statement, the City and Kitselas First Nation acknowledged the \u201cpositive step forward\u201d but noted \u201cthere is a 30-day period in which the company may seek to appeal the ruling.\u201d</p>",

That\u2019s down from 156 people recorded in 2023. Of those surveyed this year, 74 were sheltered while 57 were unsheltered.</p>\n<p>Indigenous people continue to be overrepresented among Terrace\u2019s homeless population. Sixty-one per cent of respondents identified as Indigenous, compared to about 22 per cent of Terrace\u2019s overall population. The report notes that systemic racism, intergenerational trauma, and barriers to accessing services contribute to these disproportionate rates.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>The survey found that 81 per cent of respondents reported being homeless for more than a year, and two-thirds had been without housing for five years or longer. Nearly half said they first experienced homelessness as youth, and 52 per cent had been in foster care or a group home. Respondents reported high rates of health issues, including mental illness, substance use challenges, physical disabilities, and acquired brain injuries. Many faced overlapping conditions.</p>\n<p>Substance use was very common. The most frequently reported substances were nicotine, alcohol, stimulants, cannabis and opiates. The leading reasons for losing housing included not enough income, conflict with a spouse or partner, abuse, and substance use. Nine per cent said their most recent housing loss was due to an eviction.</p>\n<p>Income insecurity was another defining factor. The majority of those surveyed relied on social assistance income or disability assistance, and just eight per cent reported regular employment.</p>\n<p>The report stresses that Point-in-Time counts represent a minimum estimate, as they only measure a single 24-hour period. By focusing on a single day, a count will not include some people who cycle in and out of homelessness, and the methodology almost certainly under-counts the true extent of homelessness in Terrace.</p>\n<p>This was the second provincial homeless count held in Terrace, following the first in 2023.

    "content_html": "<p>Healthcare and climate change were key themes at a Skeena\u2014Bulkley Valley all-candidates forum in Burns Lake on April 17.</p>\n<p>There were three candidates present: incumbent New Democratic Party candidate Taylor Bachrach, Conservative Party candidate Ellis Ross, and Christian Heritage Party candidate Rod Taylor. Not present were Inderpal Dhillon of the Liberal Party and Adeana Young of the Green Party.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Candidates were asked about their party's approach to healthcare, a question many in the audience were concerned about due to frequent emergency department closures at\u00a0the Lakes District Hospital and Health Centre, as well as a shortage of general practitioners in the area.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Taylor said his party would prevent medical procedures that his party considers unnecessary.</p>\n<p>\"We're using government health care dollars on things that are not healthcare either, the surgery to try to turn a boy into a girl, that's not healthcare. That's cosmetic surgery, that money should be going to pay for hearts and hips and things that Canadians need,\" he said.\u00a0\"We're paying for abortion killing 100,000 babies every year.\"</p>\n<p>Bachrach said that healthcare policy falls under provincial jurisdiction but his party would take measures to support the provinces such as increasing transfer payments. He added that he was inspired\u00a0recently by an alternative approach to recruiting family doctors in Fort St. James.</p>\n<p>\"At one point, Fort, St James was down to a single doctor, and he was about to retire, and they knew something had to be done, and they decided to really reinvent the wheel. They created a primary care society, a non profit society that would employ the doctors,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"Instead of doctors\u00a0working on block time, where they get a certain amount of money for every five minute appointment, they would pay them a salary. They give them a good work life balance, and they support them properly with administrative support. And they got up to the point where I think they had eight doctors.\"</p>\n<p>Ross said that doctors and nurses are being put into dangerous situations when they are asked to treat people with serious addictions issues,</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\"Alberta's got a great model. They took addictions out of the healthcare program, and they've set up treatment centres\u00a0all over Alberta, and it's fully funded,\" he said. \"Pierre Poilievre\u00a0has said that he'll treat 50,000 of those people suffering addictions.\"</p>\n<p>The candidates discussed a wide range of other issues including Indigenous policy, national debt and toxic drugs. Candidates were\u00a0asked if their party has a plan to combat climate change.</p>\n<p>Ross said his party opposes measures like the carbon tax that punish Canadians.</p>\n<p>\"We are not the biggest group in the world. We don't even criticize China, Russia, United States. We punish Canadians\u00a0with a carbon tax,\" he said, adding that the House of Commons has yet to sit and remove carbon tax legislation. \"Do you think the carbon tax is taken away? Wrong. It's separate. You can't take it away until the House sits and you get rid of legislation.\"</p>\n<p>Taylor said his party does not believe in man-made climate change.</p>\n<p>\"The Christian Heritage Party takes a position that carbon dioxide is not pollution. Carbon dioxide is plant food. It's a part of our natural atmosphere, component, component that plants need. The more they have, the better they grow,\" he said. \"The whole theory is an unproven theory. There are thousands of scientists who do not follow the theory of man caused climate change due to carbon dioxide.\"</p>\n<p>Bachrach said his party intends to meet Canada's existing international commitments regarding greenhouse gas reduction under the Paris Accord.</p>\n<p>\"Canada's target under international law is 40 to 45% reduction based on 2000 2005 levels by 2030 so that's what we've committed to to our international peers, and our party believes that Canada should fulfill that commitment,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

We\u2019re doing our best but it does start to weigh on the staff.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cWe are running on fumes for way too many of our shifts.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hospital staff feel frustrated as many of the COVID-19 patients they are treating seem to have not followed public health protocols, Dr. McCoach said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cA lot of the cases are from people not doing their part at the societal level and they\u2019re still partying, they\u2019re still socializing, they\u2019re still not taking the pandemic seriously in the way it needs to be, and unfortunately [hospital staff] are suffering because of that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really does threaten the stability of our health care system if COVID is allowed to run unchecked. I think people need to get that message a little bit clearer.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt\u2019s not a hoax. It\u2019s not influenza. It\u2019s not just a flu season that will go away. It is something that needs to be taken seriously, and really the fate of our medical system remains in the public\u2019s hands.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Dr. McCoach acknowledged the difficulties that come with pandemic safety measures.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cWe know people are tired. It\u2019s not an easy thing to ask,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are real harms from changing the way we socialize and interact but, fundamentally, this remains in [the public\u2019s] hands.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There have been COVID-19-related deaths at Mills Memorial Hospital, Dr. McCoach said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cWhen you see people that got sick sometimes having done the right thing, doing their best to stay at home, doing their best to isolate \u2026 Seeing people like that get sick, that is very demoralizing,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dr. McCoach said fewer than 20 hospital staff have received vaccines so far, but its arrival still provides some hope on the horizon for staff.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked what the public can do to help the situation and support front-line staff, beyond adhering to public health protocols, Dr. McCoach said simple gestures of gratitude would be immensely helpful.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThere is a very large team of people as well that are putting in a lot of extra hours, from pharmacy staff, physio staff, occupational therapy, the public health teams \u2026 the housekeeping staff who have gone above and beyond the call of duty,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you know somebody, send a little message just to say thank you. It is very, very difficult and demoralizing right now, and we need the extra thank-yous.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cEspecially the nurses \u2014 they have moved mountains to make sure the community remains safe.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.thenorthernview.com/news/its-not-a-hoax-terrace-hospital-busier-than-ever-with-covid-19-cases-5978773\">The Terrace Standard.</a></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n </div>",

He overcame struggles with drugs, alcohol and the hard life in his youth and now aims to be a positive influence.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One means of achieving that is through his art. Sampare is obsessed with hip-hop, having produced 15 mixtapes and two albums under his solo moniker, and he hosts a free hip-hop podcast called the Smoke House Radio which he produces from his home in Laxgalts\u2019ap (Greenville) in the Nass Valley.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cWhen I started pointing out the bad \u2026 the really obvious horrible [stuff] that\u2019s in our community, people started listening to my music,\u201d he said. \u201cLike if I said \u2018if you\u2019re selling hard drugs in my community, don\u2019t be surprised if I point you out.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI don\u2019t want no one ever poisoning my fellow man in our community because I lived that life when I was younger.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Sampare was eight years old, his father passed away and he went to live with his grandparents. In his later teenage years, he became mixed up with drugs and alcohol.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI lived in Terrace. I lived in the \u2018hood. I was a mean person back then,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But that life quickly grew stale. Fourteen years ago he quit hard drugs and he\u2019s been sober from alcohol for 10 years.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI have a lot of youth that are in my family. I\u2019ve seen them get scared of other people that are intoxicated, and I did not want that to be me,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be known as a drunk or a drug-dealer or just this gangster-ass person to the community.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt\u2019s just the rut that Indigenous [people] get caught up in or stereotyped as, and I don\u2019t want that. Ever. I wish the best for everyone, always.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sampare first became obsessed with hip-hop when he heard his cousin freestyling years ago.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cHe was smoking some weed and drinking at a party and he was freestyling, and I was like \u2018what the hell?!\u2019\u201d Sampare said. \u201cI watched him and my [other] cousin, because they were like a duo, I watched them dual like Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, they\u2019d feed off each other\u2019s energy, rap bar for bar, and I was just amazed with it.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cAfter that, I just started studying everything.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He made his cousin teach him how to write verses and choruses. With no formal training in music or audio production, he bought a microphone and a Macbook and just started making music. The early stuff is \u201ccrap,\u201d Sampare said with a laugh, but eventually he started to get the hang of it.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He spent some time as a member of a local hip-hop group called North Side Connect Gang (NSCG). The group had been trying, without success, to get airplay on radio stations like CBC Radio and CFNR, so they started podcasting for exposure.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cWe were trying to get on radio stations but we couldn\u2019t so we just started the podcast to network with other artists throughout Canada, and it just sort of blew up,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eventually, Sampare had a falling out with other members of the band, so he rebranded and went his own direction. That\u2019s when The Smoke House Radio was born. The podcast is a mix of hip-hop music, some news and random information from throughout the internet, cannabis culture and video game culture.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The name of the podcast is certainly a reference to cannabis culture, but Sampare said the name came to him when he was in a literal smoke house.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI was in the smoke house with a load of fish, I think there was like 90 fish up over my head, and I was like \u2018where there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire. You smoke your food \u2026 Everything relates around the smoke house.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Smoke House Radio averages between 2,000 and 4,000 plays per episode, with listeners around the world. Only 14 per cent of listeners are from Canada, while 33 per cent of listeners are in the United States and 15 per cent are from Germany. Sampare figures he has about 900 listeners in the Nass Valley and about 90 in Terrace.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The podcast is entirely free and Sampare said it will always stay that way.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cOnce I start charging money for it, it\u2019s just going to be haywire,\u201d he said, noting he\u2019s wary of the pitfalls that come with having an audience. \u201cI don\u2019t want to break relationships or step on people while my show is getting huge.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sampare said he\u2019s eager to grow the podcast audience and he has plans to start publishing more music (most of which hasn\u2019t been officially released) on platforms such as music streaming giant Spotify under the small label GetALifeRecords, which Sampare runs with his younger brother and frequent collaborator Eric Sampare, also known as Lyrical E.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prior to the pandemic, the brothers were booking shows in the Northwest with Dosed-Up Entertainment, an entertainment management company based in Houston, B.C. With live shows cancelled due to COVID-19, the pair are focused on writing and producing more tracks.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nevertheless, Sampare can\u2019t wait to perform again.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIf you can get a person to relate to your music and come to your shows and meet you, it is the greatest feeling in the world.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To listen to The Truth, head to\u00a0<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ronniesampare?utm_source=terrace%20standard&amp;utm_campaign=terrace%20standard%3A%20outbound&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">soundcloud.com/ronniesampare</a>\u00a0and to listen to the Smoke House Radio head to\u00a0<a href=\"https://anchor.fm/ronnie-sampare?utm_source=terrace%20standard&amp;utm_campaign=terrace%20standard%3A%20outbound&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">anchor.fm/ronnie-sampare/</a>\u00a0or look in your favourite podcast app.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.terracestandard.com/community/skeena-voices-everything-relates-around-the-smoke-house-6053288\">The Terrace Standard.</a></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n </div>",

Organizers said the rally was also to raise awareness for missing and murdered Indigenous women. Some demonstrators held signs bearing the name of Chantel Moore, a 26-year-old Indigenous woman from Vancouver Island who was shot and killed by police in New Brunswick on June 4 after moving there to be closer to her five-year-old daughter.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chants including \u201cno justice, no peace,\u201d and \u201cblack lives matter\u201d were punctuated by heavy gusts of wind, though it was clear and sunny. Plenty of demonstrators wore medical masks and some wore gloves. Many cars driving past on Eby St. honked, with some drivers and passengers giving thumbs-up to indicate support.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A handful of demonstrators took up a megaphone to share stories and messages with the crowd.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mina Lwal told the crowd she had faced racism at school in Kitimat.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThey referred to me as \u2018the ugly black girl.\u2019 \u2026 Every time I walked down the hall, I\u2019d hear them whispering, or behind my back in group chats they\u2019d talk about it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know what, I\u2019m owning it today. I\u2019m not an ugly black girl, I\u2019m for sure a beautiful South-Sudanese woman living in Canada today, in front of all of you.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lwal asked the crowd to be as loud as they possibly could for all the chants that day.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThis movement is not going anywhere, and we, as a people, are not going anywhere because we\u2019re strong,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are all one race, and that\u2019s the human race, and we all deserve to get treated as equal because at the end of the day, I bleed the same as you do, and I cry the same as you do.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amber Webb, who is black, shared with the crowd some words written by her father.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cA group of National Guard members went down on one knee in solidarity \u2026 This is what we need, rather than the hatred and violence spewing out of the White House which poisons the US, Canada, and the world,\u201d she said. \u201cOur government, cowering inside our houses of Parliament, lacking the courage to stand up to a bully or call a lie a lie, is not anything to admire.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Webb\u2019s father\u2019s words also touched upon economic inequality.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cAt the heart of all of this, our countries have become quasi-democracies, where the real power lies within the wealthiest ten per cent. If we do not serve them, they will hurt us,\u201d she said to the crowd. \u201cSurely we will look at the bullying power and luxurious life of the few, beside the poverty, suffering and powerlessness and ask \u2018can we allow this modern form of slavery to continue?\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There were some criticisms of the rally voiced in the comments of a post in the Terrace Community Bulletin Board on Facebook (though most comments were supportive.)</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI absolutely think there should be non-violent protests, but not for this. There is significantly more black-on-black crime and no one bats an eye. Where are your protests when that happens?\u201d wrote Brittany Joyce. \u201cWhat are you accomplishing?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One commenter raised safety concerns regarding the pandemic.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI hope folks are maintaining proper social distancing,\u201d wrote Warren Wilson.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the organizers of the event, Shea Kurisu, acknowledged the risk of gathering a crowd during this pandemic but said the rally was essential work. Organizers handed out free masks to demonstrators. Ultimately, Kurisu said, demonstrators were each responsible for their own safety.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kurisu said she organized the event because her husband and two children are people of colour.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI see the injustices that people of colour live with every single day, and I wanted to use my white privilege and my voice to raise the voices of those that aren\u2019t being heard,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jillian Kofoed, who organized the event alongside Kurisu, said she organized the event because she hasn\u2019t done enough to stand up to racism.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cSilence is compliance. I am not a racist, but I never said anything against racism,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to educate ourselves about all of it, we\u2019re not perfect, we\u2019ve still got a lot to learn. That\u2019s part of the reason why we\u2019re doing this today is because we needed to hear the voices of the people that this affects first-hand.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.terracestandard.com/news/anti-racism-demonstration-held-in-terrace/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Terrace Standard.</a></p>\n </div>",

(Facebook Photo)</figcaption></figure>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Persons of interest questioned, not enough evidence to pursue charges</h4>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dec. 10, 2020</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By Jake Wray</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The question \u2018what if?\u2019 has haunted Garrett Kerr for more than two years now.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His brother, Cameron Kerr, 30, was killed in a hit and run in the early hours of Nov. 18, 2018 while walking home after drinking. Cameron was a sheet metal worker by trade, but he was also a former player for the Terrace River Kings hockey team and an avid outdoorsman who loved paddling, hunting and fishing. Everyone knew he was kind and compassionate and he had a tremendous sense of humour, Garrett says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The driver of the vehicle has not been caught, despite a rigorous RCMP investigation that has turned up significant evidence and identified a group of suspects from the Lower Mainland who may have colluded to cover up the incident.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garrett and Cameron were together that night and when speaking to Garrett it\u2019s clear he has asked himself over and over what he could have done differently, as so many people do when they grieve such a loss \u2014 particularly when the investigation is incomplete, leaving the family with few answers.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The night Cameron was killed, the brothers had attended a wake for a friend who died young of an overdose. Friends and family had gathered for a bittersweet night of sharing memories, Garrett says, at a home in New Remo.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Cameron was ready to leave, he decided to walk home to Terrace along Hwy 16. It\u2019s a long walk, but not unfamiliar to the brothers, who grew up in New Remo. Before Cameron left, he had a conversation with Garrett in the driveway. Garrett tried to convince him to wait for a cab or to sleep at their parents\u2019 home in New Remo.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Cameron wanted to walk, so Garrett let him go and returned to the party.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An oncoming vehicle struck Cameron shortly after he left as he walked against traffic on the shoulder of the highway, according to the RCMP. The driver and companions took hours to cover up the incident before continuing northwest along the highway, the Kerr family says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A while after Cameron left, Garrett and a group of friends piled into a cab and headed toward Terrace. There was an energetic mood in the cab, Garrett says, and nobody was paying attention to the ditch on the opposite side of the road.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI still don\u2019t know to this day whether my brother was alive when I rode by in the cab,\u201d Garrett says, his voice breaking, in a recent interview with <em>The Terrace Standard</em>. \u201cThe longer these guys hold out and don\u2019t co-operate, the longer I have to live with that.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cameron\u2019s body was found in the ditch around noon by a member of the public.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garrett had been trying to reach Cameron that morning and had gone by Cameron\u2019s place to find he wasn\u2019t home. Then Garrett drove back out toward New Remo with a sinking feeling in his gut.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI had made most of the drive out there wondering,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd sure enough I came around the next corner and there was a police stoppage and police tape.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Police quickly identified a suspect vehicle, a 2011-2016 Ford F350 pickup truck. Tips from the public lead police to discover an abandoned boat trailer associated with the case.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then on Nov. 21, just days after Cameron was killed, police announced they had identified a truck on Haida Gwaii with damage consistent with the collision and said they were confident they had identified a suspect driver who was from the Lower Mainland. They seized the suspect F350 truck, another truck and two boat trailers (in addition to the abandoned boat trailer discovered earlier). Police questioned seven people who may have been involved in the incident.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, nothing. The RCMP didn\u2019t quite have enough evidence to recommend charges. Garrett and his family held a press conference on Dec. 19, one month after Cameron was killed, appealing for people to come forward with information.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They were joined by Sgt. Shawn McLaughlin, the primary RCMP member on the case.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cWe will not relent until we deliver the driver responsible [and he] is brought to justice,\u201d Sgt. McLaughlin said at the press conference. \u201cThe last thing I want to see is that those responsible, or those that are hiding evidence \u2026 enjoying their Christmas while forgetting the faces of those you see here today.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">RCMP conducted a search for evidence along Hwy 16 in April 2019, once weather conditions permitted, aided by members of Terrace and Prince Rupert Search and Rescue organizations. The search yielded several pertinent items, police said, though they did not disclose the nature of the items.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since then, the Kerr family has remained focused on asking the suspects, as well as the suspects\u2019 families and friends, to come forward with information. The Kerr family held another public appeal press conference (their third) in November 2019, about a year after Cameron was killed.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And they paid for a letter to be published in Lower Mainland newspapers in April 2020, summarizing their understanding of the incident and pleading for associates of the suspects to come forward.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cTo the parents, wives, girlfriends and friends of a group of men from the Lower Mainland: In November 2018, these men set off for a fishing and hunting trip to Haida Gwaii,\u201d the letter begins.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cAfter passing through Terrace, they were involved in a tragic collision \u2026 after the collision, they spent hours hiding their damaged boat trailer in the woods \u2026 they transferred the boat to the new trailer and proceeded to Haida Gwaii as if nothing had happened. The persons responsible for his death knowingly left Cameron to die alone, not caring enough to call for help.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cTheir trucks, boats and trailers were all impounded by the police, so when they returned to the Lower Mainland, it was without those possessions \u2026 If you recognize these men by this story, the family of Cameron Kerr pleads with you to urge [the suspects] to do the right thing and go to the authorities so that this nightmare can end for Cameron\u2019s family, as well as these individuals.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garrett says the family does not blame the RCMP for the fact that the investigation has not been concluded and they are grateful for the work the RCMP have done.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But they still want justice.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThere is a part of the grieving process that is not available to us while this is hanging over our heads,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sgt. McLaughlin, speaking to <em>The Terrace Standard</em> on Dec. 2, 2020, says he can\u2019t share many details of the current status of the investigation, but he says police are not sitting idly waiting for someone to come forward.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re at a dead end in that regard,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s possible other means that I can\u2019t get into that we might resort to.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He says the RCMP are keeping the Kerr family in the loop as much as possible.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThat\u2019s been a strong goal of ours is to make sure that we\u2019re engaged with the family because we do realize it\u2019s been two years and they want that assurance and they deserve that assurance to know that this hasn\u2019t fallen off our plate,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are still continuing to investigate and use various means to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sgt. McLaughlin added that the investigation has shown police that Cameron was very well respected in his community.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt\u2019s a very important file to the community and it\u2019s a very important file to our membership here,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really close to our hearts and we\u2019re working on it the best we can every day.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The River Kings held tributes to Cameron at home games in 2018 and 2019 and the community showed up in force to both games. Each year, the Terrace Pipes and Drums Society performed at the games in commemoration of Cameron\u2019s Scottish heritage. The team likely would have held a tribute again this year but the league cancelled its season due to the pandemic.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Steve Cullis, captain of the River Kings, is a friend of Garrett and Cameron\u2019s. He was with the brothers at the wake the night Cameron was killed.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt was pretty tough news,\u201d he says. \u201cI want some closure for the family more than anything. How long do they have to keep guessing as to what exactly happened?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garrett says the grief of losing his brother comes in waves.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThe first couple of months it\u2019s just like nothing you could have ever imagined. Then you sort of get to where you just have to be able to function in your life,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are times when I\u2019m just angry \u2026 I don\u2019t know. You just aren\u2019t ever going to be the same.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cAt the same time, I don\u2019t think Cameron would have wanted us all to be in that sort of head space forever either.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In November of this year, near the anniversary of Cameron\u2019s death, a small group of family and friends went to the spot where his body was found to visit a memorial. It\u2019s made of antlers, to repesent his love of hunting, his fishing rod, and kayaking oars to represent his love of paddling.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cameron would have wanted those who love him to come together to support each other in grief, Garrett says, so they have strived to do that, even though it\u2019s been challenging during the pandemic. And Cameron would have wanted them to laugh together.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cHe was one of the funniest people you\u2019d ever know,\u201d Garrett says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garrett has so many wonderful memories of his brother from over the years, and often it\u2019s the more recent happy memories that come to his mind. He recalls time they spent running together, and laughs as he admits Cameron was the better runner.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cWe\u2019d spend a bit of time training for the King of the Mountain [foot race] or just running for the heck of it,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I want to really remember him, I try to go run around Terrace Mountain and feel like I\u2019m getting my ass kicked, because I certainly felt that way when I was running with him.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garrett is thankful to the Terrace area community for its support.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cEverybody up here thinks about Cameron all the time and they\u2019ve been so helpful in the investigation,\u201d he says. \u201cBut really the people that can make a difference at this point are living their lives down south.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>\u2013 With files from Natalia Balcerzak</em></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em><strong>Police are asking anyone with information and who has not already spoken with police to call Sgt.

Photo courtesy Natasha Candelora.</figcaption></figure>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">B.C. ministry unhelpful in aftermath of fire, family says</h4>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nov. 18, 2020</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By Jake Wray</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Natasha Candelora left her house in Old Remo around 5:10 p.m. on Oct. 7 to take her two children into town for Taekwondo practice. Within an hour, their home burned to the ground, leaving behind only a smoldering pile of rubble.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fire was devastating for the family. Not only did it completely destroy their home and all their possessions (including irreplaceable photographs), it also jeopardized Natasha\u2019s eligibility to continue as a foster parent to the two children, whom she has cared for the last seven years and loves as her own.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She said that day leading up to the fire was a bit hectic but relatively normal. She spent the day on a cleaning frenzy and prepped dinner before rounding the kids up for the trip into town.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was Natasha\u2019s parents, Bob and Barb Wilson, and brother Tony Candelora who saw smoke rising from Natasha\u2019s house. They live right next door in another house on the same property \u2014 a small farm where the family keeps a few horses and domestic pets.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bob and Tony rushed outside when they saw the smoke. Tony didn\u2019t even put on shoes. Bob said they went inside the burning house to get the pets out.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThe whole roof of the house, inside the house, was just swirling with smoke,\u201d Bob said. \u201cThere was no flames or nothing, it was just smoke. Black smoke, just like curls on a woman\u2019s hair \u2026 It was weird. It really was.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tony got the dog, Redford, a rust-coloured doberman, out safely. The cats took care of themselves. Bob and Tony got the rabbits out.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThen we turned around and looked back and the whole roof just come down,\u201d Bob said, noting that when he and Tony opened the door to enter, air flowed up to the fire smoldering in the roof of the home. \u201cProbably within less than 45 seconds the whole thing just come crashing down.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Barb dialed 9-1-1, momentarily forgetting that their property is outside the Thornhill Volunteer Fire Department\u2019s coverage zone. The operator reiterated that fact and dispatched RCMP to assist.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rick Boehm, chief of the Thornhill fire department, told <em>The Terrace Standard </em>that it\u2019s always tough for the fire department when they hear about a fire just outside their protection zone. The zone boundary is a federally-mandated 8-kilometre radius around the fire hall. Firefighters are only allowed to leave their protection boundary when someone\u2019s life is in danger, such as a person trapped in a burning building, which wasn\u2019t the case with this fire.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Barb said it wouldn\u2019t have mattered anyway. From start to finish, the fire only lasted about 20 minutes, and she figures the fire department wouldn\u2019t have been able to react in time.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boehm said that it does indeed take some time to get fire engines out to Old Remo.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThe Old Remo location is sort of compound affected by the significant climb up that hill,\u201d he said. \u201c[Fire engines] can only go so quick on that little road and it is quite a slug to get those heavy, heavy trucks up that hill.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, the kids were at Taekwando and Natasha was relaxing at Cafenara with her boyfriend, Terry Healy, who had just arrived in Terrace that evening after a day of work in Prince Rupert. That\u2019s when Natasha\u2019s cell phone rang.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cMy mom\u2019s yelling at me \u2018Your house is on fire\u2019 and I\u2019m like \u2018what?\u2019\u201d Natasha said. \u201cYou\u2019re in shock when you hear that.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She rushed to gather the children from Taekwando while Terry jumped in his truck and drove like mad out to Old Remo. Even at breakneck speed, the roughly 14-kilometre drive from Terrace to the farm still leaves enough time for one\u2019s mind to churn.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI was wondering how far along the fire was. Can we save anything?\u201d Terry said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that the house was totally gone. I didn\u2019t assume it would be that bad [but] as soon as I started down Queensway, and you look back this way, all you could see is a cloud of black smoke.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Natasha was just minutes behind with the children.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt looked like the whole forest was on fire,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When she arrived, she noticed a collection of onlookers.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cWe had a lineup of people sitting in their cars, and I have to say, for me one of the most awful feelings is people sitting in their vehicle with their windows rolled up watching your house burn down,\u201d Natasha said, tears welling in her eyes as she recalled the memory.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But there were also friendly neighbours who arrived to help. A pair of them comforted Natasha.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThey\u2019re holding me and I\u2019m getting sick beside the car,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming, the grief, the panic that goes through your mind.\u201d</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-517\" data-attachment-id=\"517\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5600\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1604153925\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"18\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.016666666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"candelora-family\" data-large-file=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/jakewray-portfolio/media/journalism/foster-family-loses-home-to-fire/candelora-family.jpg?w=660\" data-medium-file=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/jakewray-portfolio/media/journalism/foster-family-loses-home-to-fire/candelora-family.jpg?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/jakewray-portfolio/media/journalism/foster-family-loses-home-to-fire/candelora-family.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3074,2183\" data-permalink=\"https://jakewrayportfolio.wordpress.com/candelora-family/\" height=\"494\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/jakewray-portfolio/media/journalism/foster-family-loses-home-to-fire/foster-family-loses-home-to-fire-2.jpg\" width=\"697\"/><figcaption>Natasha Candelora, centre, relaxes in her parents\u2019 living room on Oct. 30, weeks after the fire, alongside her partner Terry Healy, left, and her father Bob Wilson, right. (Jake Wray/Terrace Standard)</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nearly four weeks after the fire, the smell of smoke still hangs in the air at the family farm. It\u2019s Oct. 30 and the rubble has yet to be cleared. Redford, the doberman, has bandages on his front paws because he cut them mucking about in the debris.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The debris won\u2019t be cleared until Natasha\u2019s insurance processes the claim, and snow might fall before that, meaning cleanup may not happen until next year. Candelora says dealing with the insurance company has been straightforward (the company already supplied emergency funding for a hotel stay and items such as clothes) but the process inherently takes time. She is also waiting for the insurance company to complete an investigation of the fire and determine the cause \u2014 something the fire department would do, if Natasha\u2019s home were within the fire protection district.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The family sits in the living room of Bob and Barb\u2019s home. Natasha is still under a lot of stress trying to sort out new living arrangements and replace essential items, and the whole family is worn out from the ordeal. But they haven\u2019t lost their senses of humour. They all laugh as Barb describes how Natasha\u2019s cats moved themselves, with an air of entitlement, into Bob and Barb\u2019s home.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The children, who are both around 12 years old, are coping fairly well, all things considered. The brother and sister are not identified in this story because provincial policy prevents foster children from being identified in the media. Initially, the girl was scared to go back to school because she was afraid of what all the other kids would say, but when she did go back she found her peers to be caring and supportive. The boy has expressed some anger following the fire.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bob and Natasha also say they are frustrated, particularly with B.C.\u2019s Ministry of Children and Family Development, which oversees the foster care program. Bob and Barb are also foster parents, currently caring for four children. Bob and Barb have been foster parents for 25 years and Natasha has been a foster parent for 19 years. They say the ministry has been insulting and unhelpful in the aftermath of the fire, despite the decades-long relationship between the family and the ministry.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Almost immediately after the fire, a ministry worker informed Natasha that she had 30 days to find a new place or the children could be taken from her because Natasha\u2019s contract with the ministry states she must have her own dwelling with enough bedrooms for each of the children to have their own.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt\u2019s tough some days, but it is equally rewarding or you wouldn\u2019t do it. It\u2019s not for everyone to be a foster parent, but it\u2019s something we\u2019ve chosen as a family to give back. We feel it\u2019s our calling,\u201d Natasha says. \u201cAnd then I don\u2019t have the home any more so now I\u2019m told \u2026 \u2018you have a month to find a suitable place to raise these children.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Candelora says the ministry\u2019s lack of flexibility on the timeline is unreasonable because rental properties are scarce in the Terrace area and the ministry offered no help in locating a rental or financial assistance with rent despite the fact that rent prices are much higher than her monthly mortgage payment. She says the ministry should have contingency funding to support foster families in crises.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cYou would think that there would be maybe something set aside by the government for emergency,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that there isn\u2019t some funding.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She says the notion that her children could be taken from her adds unnecessary pressure to an already stressful situation.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cSo these kids that know no one but me as their mother would have to go live with someone [else],\u201d Natasha says through tears. \u201cIf they\u2019re not with me they\u2019ve been with my parents. They don\u2019t know anyone but us. And they\u2019re going to have to suffer and be punished for something out of all of our control? Because it\u2019s not [ministry] policy?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cWhen we try to resolve situations in the ministry, we always get \u2018well, it\u2019s our policy,\u2019\u201d Bob says. \u201cEven though the policy doesn\u2019t make any common sense, even if you couldn\u2019t live by that policy, we are expected to live by that policy.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ministry offered only limited financial support to replace the children\u2019s belongings like jackets and boots, Bob says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt was very insulting for [ministry workers] to come out here two days after the fire with a dozen donuts and four cups of coffee and $200 for one child and $200 for another child to replace everything that [the children] owned,\u201d Bob says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The family says they could face consequences for speaking out against the ministry, which has a culture of silence, but they are fed up with the mistreatment.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cBecause of what I have said \u2026 I could [metaphorically] have a knife to my throat tomorrow,\u201d Bob says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt\u2019s their own little secret society,\u201d Natasha says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt\u2019s sad. And that\u2019s why in our community we have very few foster parents. And very few relief workers,\u201d Bob says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A manager of the local ministry office refused a request for comment and would not provide a reason why.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Angus Noble, a public affairs officer who works for the ministry at the provincial level, said foster parents are required to have their own home insurance that covers emergencies like fires or floods.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIn addition, [the ministry] supports the availability of \u2018Extended Property Damage (Rider) Insurance\u2019 to supplement a residential caregiver\u2019s homeowner or tenant insurance policy,\u201d Noble said in an email statement. \u201cThis mirrors a foster parent\u2019s basic coverage where damage is caused by a child or youth in care.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Noble said that when a foster parent suddenly loses access to housing, the ministry will work the parent to find a suitable alternative. He said that if the foster parent\u2019s insurance didn\u2019t cover the cost of alternative housing, the ministry may be able to pay for temporary support such as a hotel stay.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u2014 ~ \u2014</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Nov. 5, Natasha said she had finally secured a rental for her and the children. That was a great relief, she said, though many challenges for the family still lie ahead, such as ironing out insurance details, managing the tricky financial situation, and creating a sense of normalcy for the children.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She\u2019s deeply grateful to the Terrace area community who helped her family by donating money and clothing, particularly for the children.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThey\u2019ve got a decent pair of winter boots on their feet,\u201d she said. \u201cWithout the community\u2019s help, honestly I would have been screwed.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Natasha said relying on the community and her family for help can be uncomfortable at times, because she was so proud to have lived as an independent woman raising her children before the fire. Nevertheless, she appreciates the help.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.terracestandard.com/news/foster-family-loses-old-remo-home-to-fire/\">The Terrace Standard.</a></p>\n </div>",

(Mike Dangeli/Instagram)</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Oct. 30, 2020</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By Jake Wray</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mike Dangeli is a Tsimshian, Nisga\u2019a and Tlingit artist and community leader.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He recently carved a memorial totem pole for missing and murdered Indigenous women, and he lead the raising ceremony for the totem pole on Kitsumkalum territory on Sept. 4.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 47-year-old father of three lives in Terrace with his wife Mique\u2019l and their son Hayetsk, who is nearly a year old. Dangeli has two older sons, Nick and Michael, who are in their twenties.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dangeli has been immersed in Northwest Indigenous culture and making art since he was a boy, but he walked a long path before becoming an established, full-time artist.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He was born in the tiny village of Stella, Missouri, near an army base where his biological father was stationed. His family only stayed a few months there \u2014 they moved often due to military obligations. When his parents separated, Dangeli moved with his mom to California, Washington State and finally, southern Alaska.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Growing up, he spent time in southern Alaska and northern B.C., having family roots on both sides of the border.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the summers, he spent countless hours on a boat fishing with his Nisga\u2019a grandfather, who instructed him in Nisga\u2019a <em>adaawk</em> (oral history) and <em>ayuuk</em> (laws and protocol). He also learned from his grandmother, who was a gifted artist.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cNot only did she do beading and weaving and leather work, but she also was a landscape painter as well as a portrait painter,\u201d he said. \u201cHer and my mom were my first art teachers.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Relatives also instructed him in the Tsimshian and Tlingit cultures. On the Tlingit side, he learned to make drums, which he traded for regalia, knowledge or tools.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a teenager, Dangeli played varsity football in Alaska and continued his cultural education on both sides of the border.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When he was 17, he enlisted with the United States Army (to his mother\u2019s dismay), inspired by a long family history of military service. Many of his uncles served in Vietnam and Korea, including his uncle Bill, a marine who fought in the Fall of Saigon in 1975. Both of Dangeli\u2019s grandfathers fought in the Second World War. A great-grandfather on his mother\u2019s side was a member of the Alaska Territorial Guard.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dangeli served 10 years and did four tours of combat. He served in the Army Airborne, the Army Air Assault, and the Army Rangers. Those tours were through the UN\u2019s involvement in the Somali Civil War, during the First Gulf War and at several other locations he cannot discuss.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Confidentiality agreements prevent him from publicly speaking about much of his time in the military, but he left with an honourable discharge.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dangeli has grown critical of his time in the military.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI tell my sons, I\u2019ve been shot and stabbed and chewed enough dirt on foreign soil and fought enough that they don\u2019t have to,\u201d he said. \u201cI look at where I was deployed and who sent me there, and it\u2019s always rich politicians who are sending poor people off to war. I think that\u2019s the way it\u2019s been since the beginning of time. But I just don\u2019t agree with the politics of where they\u2019re sending us as soldiers, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re really fighting for freedom and everything like we\u2019re being told we are.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI still support our troops, because it\u2019s not their choice. They\u2019re not wanting to go do this. They\u2019re just following orders.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Being in the military meant missing out on some of his oldest son\u2019s early years, something Dangeli regretted.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI had him so young and then of course being deployed or away so many times, I felt like I missed a lot. And as a father, you know, that\u2019s a pop in the chops,\u201d he said. \u201cI was able to reconnect and having some amazing time with him as a young pre-teen and teenager and all the way up into his adulthood.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Returning to civilian life was a difficult transition for Dangeli, as it is for so many soldiers. He carried a lot of pain home, but culture and tradition kept him grounded.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201dKnowing who I am, as far as being a Nisga\u2019a/Tlingit/Tsimshian man, and practising my people\u2019s traditions from an early age, being immersed in them \u2026 I really feel like helped me survive all of that,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when I came home with lots of baggage, and was angry about some of the things I had to do in combat. The culture and the art saved my life.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dangeli used the American GI Bill to go back to school in Alaska. He worked as a fisherman and in tourism. He transferred to school in Washington State where, for a time, he was intent on becoming a history teacher. He did an intensive carving apprenticeship under David Boxley, a Tsimshian artist from Metlakatla, Alaska.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then he went through a difficult divorce. Hurting from that, and still bearing some pain from his years of service, Dangeli planned to return to the Nass Valley to lick his wounds. But first he stopped off in Vancouver, where he needed to earn a little cash.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He was asked to complete a totem pole that had been abandoned halfway through the carving process. The original carvers, who seemed to struggle with addiction issues, took an initial payment for work on the pole and then disappeared. Subsequently, the totem pole was stolen twice, ending up on Vancouver Island at one point. It was beaten with a baseball bat. Somebody spray painted a racist name for Indigenous people on it.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dangeli related to the beat-up pole.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt just was abused, so I saw it as a physical manifestation of where I was at,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He ended up getting a grant to have 12 youth work with him on the totem pole project. He taught them how to hold a traditional pole-raising potlatch, how to make gifts for the potlatch, and other protocols.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As many as 500 kids from the Vancouver area came by to help work on the totem pole itself.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt ended up being this really beautiful moment,\u201d Dangeli said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After that, the friendship centre where he had been carving invited him to stay a while, to hold some workshops and things of that nature. He ended up living in the Lower Mainland for 20 years.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He met his wife, Mique\u2019l, when they both apprenticed under the same master carver. Among many other activities over the years, they traveled the world with their dance group Git Hayetsk. They danced all over North America, including on Broadway, and they danced in Germany, Japan and Malaysia.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A few years ago, Dangeli and his wife were both invited to work and teach at \u2018Na Aksa Gyilak\u2019yoo School in Kitsumkalum, so they moved to Terrace. They\u2019ve been here since.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Normally the family are quite busy, working on various art projects, teaching or speaking engagements, or cultural activities on both sides of the border. But with COVID-19 and the border closure, they are having a relatively quiet year.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dangeli wished he could have seen his older sons more this year, but he relishes being able to spend quality time at home, especially with his son Hayetsk being at a formative age. Hayetsk has been immersed in his father\u2019s artwork this year, participating in carving in his own way. The little guy is already beginning to learn the cultural lessons that saved his father years ago.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201dHe loves coming in when I\u2019m in my painting studio, coming and looking over things,\u201d Dangeli said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing to see this little toddler emulate so much of what is going on in his life.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.terracestandard.com/community/skeena-voices-the-culture-and-the-art-saved-my-life/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Terrace Standard.</a></p>\n </div>",

The resulting lava flow is believed to have killed approximately 2,000 Nisga\u2019a people, destroying three villages in the Nass Valley. This scientific understanding is corroborated by Nisga\u2019a oral history. Now the vast fields of lava rock are preserved as a provincial park, jointly managed by the Nisga\u2019a Lisims government and the B.C. government.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The volcano has been researched before, but until now there had never been extensive mapping of the volcano cone or the beds of lava rock that were formed when lava flowed 32 km into the valley, nor had a precise timeline of events been established.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In summer 2016, researchers from SFU, UBC, and Quest University in Squamish began fieldwork in the lava beds, returning again in the summers of 2017 and 2019. They studied the surface of the lava beds, measured the depth of the lava beds at various points, and measured the depth of Lava Lake and Melita Lake, to determine how much lava had flowed into those waters. The researchers also obtained aerial photos of the volcano cone and lava beds. The data was then punched into 3D modelling software for further insight.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The research culminated in a paper called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17445647.2020.1758809\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Physical</a><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17445647.2020.1758809\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> volcanology of Tseax </a><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17445647.2020.1758809\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Volcano,</a>\u201d which was published online May 12. Lead author of the paper Yannick Le Moigne is a PhD candidate at SFU and the paper is his PhD thesis.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Le Moigne told <em>The Terrace Standard </em>that the biggest surprise from the research was just how much lava flowed from the relatively small volcano.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThe volcano is very, very small compared to the lava flow,\u201d he said, comparing the size of the lava flow to the size of the Skeena River today. \u201c[It was] an enormous volume of lava flow, very hot \u2026 flowing like a river in the valleys, reaching the [Nisga\u2019a] villages in a day or two, destroying everything in its path.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many of the Nisga\u2019a people were killed by a poisonous gas, not the lava itself, according to Nisga\u2019a oral history that was recorded in the Canadian Geographical Journal in 1935. Le Moigne said that is likely true, but he and other researchers can only speculate about gasses related to the eruption.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThey were not necessarily killed by the lava flow, but maybe once the lava flow arrived, was in contact with the Nass River, there would have been some gas emissions,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have \u2026 a very hot lava flow, in contact with the cold water like the Nass River, you have a lot of emissions of vapor of water, but also any volcanic gasses like CO2, sulphuric gasses, etc., and if you smell those gasses you could be in trouble.\u201d</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-487\" data-attachment-id=\"487\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"200611-tst-tseax-volcano-2\" data-large-file=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/jakewray-portfolio/media/journalism/scientists-produce-extensive-map-of-tseax-volcano-lava-flow/200611-tst-tseax-volcano-2.jpeg?w=660\" data-medium-file=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/jakewray-portfolio/media/journalism/scientists-produce-extensive-map-of-tseax-volcano-lava-flow/200611-tst-tseax-volcano-2.jpeg?w=246\" data-orig-file=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/jakewray-portfolio/media/journalism/scientists-produce-extensive-map-of-tseax-volcano-lava-flow/200611-tst-tseax-volcano-2.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"1500,1831\" data-permalink=\"https://jakewrayportfolio.wordpress.com/200611-tst-tseax-volcano-2/\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/jakewray-portfolio/media/journalism/scientists-produce-extensive-map-of-tseax-volcano-lava-flow/scientists-produce-extensive-map-of-tseax-volcano-lava-flow-2.jpeg\" width=\"839\"/></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Tseax Volcano is unlikely to erupt again, Le Moigne said. It was formed as the result of rifting, where two tectonic places pull apart, thinning the Earth\u2019s crust and allowing magma to spill out from the Earth\u2019s mantle. This process typically results in volcanos that only erupt once, which is true for most volcanos in northern B.C. and Alaska.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cAll these volcanos, like 90 per cent of them, are monogenetic volcanos, because they only erupted one time, and then [they stop],\u201d Le Moigne said. \u201cSo, at the moment, we are thinking that Tseax is also a monogenetic volcano \u2026 But we are not 100 per cent sure, maybe in the future there will be another eruption.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Le Moigne, who is from France, said he chose to come work on the Tseax Volcano for his PhD because the volcano had barely been studied.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIt was an opportunity to study everything, from the basic, to the more complex history of the volcano,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nisga\u2019a people provided great assistance to the research, Le Moigne said, a contribution not available in most earth science studies.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThey gave us a lot of data from their oral histories, and that helped us a lot when we wrote, step by step, what happened at Tseax,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very cool project to merge the two aspects of the world. You have the [earth] science, and then you have the \u2026 social science from the Nisga\u2019a.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.terracestandard.com/news/scientists-produce-extensive-map-of-tseax-volcano-lava-flow/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Terrace Standard.</a></p>\n </div>",

Within an hour, their home burned to the ground, leaving behind only a smoldering pile of rubble.</p>\n<p>The fire was devastating for the family. Not only did it completely destroy their home and all their possessions (including irreplaceable photographs), it also jeopardized Natasha\u2019s eligibility to continue as a foster parent to the two children, whom she has cared for the last seven years and loves as her own.</p>\n<p>She said that day leading up to the fire was a bit hectic but relatively normal. She spent the day on a cleaning frenzy and prepped dinner before rounding the kids up for the trip into town.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>It was Natasha\u2019s parents, Bob and Barb Wilson, and brother Tony Candelora who saw smoke rising from Natasha\u2019s house. They live right next door in another house on the same property \u2014 a small farm where the family keeps a few horses and domestic pets.</p>\n<p>Bob and Tony rushed outside when they saw the smoke. Tony didn\u2019t even put on shoes. Bob said they went inside the burning house to get the pets out.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe whole roof of the house, inside the house, was just swirling with smoke,\u201d Bob said. \u201cThere was no flames or nothing, it was just smoke. Black smoke, just like curls on a woman\u2019s hair \u2026 It was weird. It really was.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony got the dog, Redford, a rust-coloured doberman, out safely. The cats took care of themselves. Bob and Tony got the rabbits out.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen we turned around and looked back and the whole roof just come down,\u201d Bob said, noting that when he and Tony opened the door to enter, air flowed up to the fire smoldering in the roof of the home. \u201cProbably within less than 45 seconds the whole thing just come crashing down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Barb dialed 9-1-1, momentarily forgetting that their property is outside the Thornhill Volunteer Fire Department\u2019s coverage zone. The operator reiterated that fact and dispatched RCMP to assist.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Rick Boehm, chief of the Thornhill fire department, told <em>The Terrace Standard </em>that it\u2019s always tough for the fire department when they hear about a fire just outside their protection zone. The zone boundary is a federally-mandated 8-kilometre radius around the fire hall. Firefighters are only allowed to leave their protection boundary when someone\u2019s life is in danger, such as a person trapped in a burning building, which wasn\u2019t the case with this fire.</p>\n<p>Barb said it wouldn\u2019t have mattered anyway. From start to finish, the fire only lasted about 20 minutes, and she figures the fire department wouldn\u2019t have been able to react in time.</p>\n<p>Boehm said that it does indeed take some time to get fire engines out to Old Remo.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Old Remo location is sort of compound affected by the significant climb up that hill,\u201d he said. \u201c[Fire engines] can only go so quick on that little road and it is quite a slug to get those heavy, heavy trucks up that hill.\u201d</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the kids were at Taekwando and Natasha was relaxing at Cafenara with her boyfriend, Terry Healy, who had just arrived in Terrace that evening after a day of work in Prince Rupert. That\u2019s when Natasha\u2019s cell phone rang.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mom\u2019s yelling at me \u2018Your house is on fire\u2019 and I\u2019m like \u2018what?\u2019\u201d Natasha said. \u201cYou\u2019re in shock when you hear that.\u201d</p>\n<p>She rushed to gather the children from Taekwando while Terry jumped in his truck and drove like mad out to Old Remo. Even at breakneck speed, the roughly 14-kilometre drive from Terrace to the farm still leaves enough time for one\u2019s mind to churn.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was wondering how far along the fire was. Can we save anything?\u201d Terry said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that the house was totally gone. I didn\u2019t assume it would be that bad [but] as soon as I started down Queensway, and you look back this way, all you could see is a cloud of black smoke.\u201d</p>\n<p>Natasha was just minutes behind with the children.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt looked like the whole forest was on fire,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>When she arrived, she noticed a collection of onlookers.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe had a lineup of people sitting in their cars, and I have to say, for me one of the most awful feelings is people sitting in their vehicle with their windows rolled up watching your house burn down,\u201d Natasha said, tears welling in her eyes as she recalled the memory.</p>\n<p>But there were also friendly neighbours who arrived to help. A pair of them comforted Natasha.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re holding me and I\u2019m getting sick beside the car,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming, the grief, the panic that goes through your mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014 ~ \u2014</p>\n<p>Nearly four weeks after the fire, the smell of smoke still hangs in the air at the family farm. It\u2019s Oct. 30 and the rubble has yet to be cleared. Redford, the doberman, has bandages on his front paws because he cut them mucking about in the debris.</p>\n<p>The debris won\u2019t be cleared until Natasha\u2019s insurance processes the claim, and snow might fall before that, meaning cleanup may not happen until next year. Candelora says dealing with the insurance company has been straightforward (the company already supplied emergency funding for a hotel stay and items such as clothes) but the process inherently takes time. She is also waiting for the insurance company to complete an investigation of the fire and determine the cause \u2014 something the fire department would do, if Natasha\u2019s home were within the fire protection district.</p>\n<p>The family sits in the living room of Bob and Barb\u2019s home. Natasha is still under a lot of stress trying to sort out new living arrangements and replace essential items, and the whole family is worn out from the ordeal. But they haven\u2019t lost their senses of humour. They all laugh as Barb describes how Natasha\u2019s cats moved themselves, with an air of entitlement, into Bob and Barb\u2019s home.</p>\n<p>The children, who are both around 12 years old, are coping fairly well, all things considered. The brother and sister are not identified in this story because provincial policy prevents foster children from being identified in the media. Initially, the girl was scared to go back to school because she was afraid of what all the other kids would say, but when she did go back she found her peers to be caring and supportive. The boy has expressed some anger following the fire.</p>\n<p>Bob and Natasha also say they are frustrated, particularly with B.C.\u2019s Ministry of Children and Family Development, which oversees the foster care program. Bob and Barb are also foster parents, currently caring for four children. Bob and Barb have been foster parents for 25 years and Natasha has been a foster parent for 19 years. They say the ministry has been insulting and unhelpful in the aftermath of the fire, despite the decades-long relationship between the family and the ministry.</p>\n<p>Almost immediately after the fire, a ministry worker informed Natasha that she had 30 days to find a new place or the children could be taken from her because Natasha\u2019s contract with the ministry states she must have her own dwelling with enough bedrooms for each of the children to have their own.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s tough some days, but it is equally rewarding or you wouldn\u2019t do it. It\u2019s not for everyone to be a foster parent, but it\u2019s something we\u2019ve chosen as a family to give back. We feel it\u2019s our calling,\u201d Natasha says. \u201cAnd then I don\u2019t have the home any more so now I\u2019m told \u2026 \u2018you have a month to find a suitable place to raise these children.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Candelora says the ministry\u2019s lack of flexibility on the timeline is unreasonable because rental properties are scarce in the Terrace area and the ministry offered no help in locating a rental or financial assistance with rent despite the fact that rent prices are much higher than her monthly mortgage payment. She says the ministry should have contingency funding to support foster families in crises.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou would think that there would be maybe something set aside by the government for emergency,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that there isn\u2019t some funding.\u201d</p>\n<p>She says the notion that her children could be taken from her adds unnecessary pressure to an already stressful situation.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo these kids that know no one but me as their mother would have to go live with someone [else],\u201d Natasha says through tears. \u201cIf they\u2019re not with me they\u2019ve been with my parents. They don\u2019t know anyone but us. And they\u2019re going to have to suffer and be punished for something out of all of our control? Because it\u2019s not [ministry] policy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we try to resolve situations in the ministry, we always get \u2018well, it\u2019s our policy,\u2019\u201d Bob says. \u201cEven though the policy doesn\u2019t make any common sense, even if you couldn\u2019t live by that policy, we are expected to live by that policy.\u201d</p>\n<p>The ministry offered only limited financial support to replace the children\u2019s belongings like jackets and boots, Bob says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was very insulting for [ministry workers] to come out here two days after the fire with a dozen donuts and four cups of coffee and $200 for one child and $200 for another child to replace everything that [the children] owned,\u201d Bob says.</p>\n<p>The family says they could face consequences for speaking out against the ministry, which has a culture of silence, but they are fed up with the mistreatment.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause of what I have said \u2026 I could [metaphorically] have a knife to my throat tomorrow,\u201d Bob says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s their own little secret society,\u201d Natasha says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s sad. And that\u2019s why in our community we have very few foster parents. And very few relief workers,\u201d Bob says.</p>\n<p>A manager of the local ministry office refused a request for comment and would not provide a reason why.</p>\n<p>Angus Noble, a public affairs officer who works for the ministry at the provincial level, said foster parents are required to have their own home insurance that covers emergencies like fires or floods.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn addition, [the ministry] supports the availability of \u2018Extended Property Damage (Rider) Insurance\u2019 to supplement a residential caregiver\u2019s homeowner or tenant insurance policy,\u201d Noble said in an email statement. \u201cThis mirrors a foster parent\u2019s basic coverage where damage is caused by a child or youth in care.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noble said that when a foster parent suddenly loses access to housing, the ministry will work the parent to find a suitable alternative. He said that if the foster parent\u2019s insurance didn\u2019t cover the cost of alternative housing, the ministry may be able to pay for temporary support such as a hotel stay.</p>\n<p>\u2014 ~ \u2014</p>\n<p>On Nov. 5, Natasha said she had finally secured a rental for her and the children. That was a great relief, she said, though many challenges for the family still lie ahead, such as ironing out insurance details, managing the tricky financial situation, and creating a sense of normalcy for the children.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s deeply grateful to the Terrace area community who helped her family by donating money and clothing, particularly for the children.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got a decent pair of winter boots on their feet,\u201d she said. \u201cWithout the community\u2019s help, honestly I would have been screwed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Natasha said relying on the community and her family for help can be uncomfortable at times, because she was so proud to have lived as an independent woman raising her children before the fire. Nevertheless, she appreciates the help.</p>\n<p>Anyone interested in providing support to the family can contact Natasha directly at natashacandelora@gmail, or through Facebook.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img alt=\"23192331_web1_fire-debris-1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/jakewray-portfolio/media/journalism/foster-family-loses-old-remo-home-to-fire/23192331_web1_fire-debris-1.jpg\"/><figcaption>Natasha Candelora and her family are waiting for their insurance company to process their claim before debris from their home that burned down.

The event was live-streamed through Facebook and the <em>Terrace Standard\u2019s </em>website and was moderated by <em>Terrace Standard</em> reporter Jake Wray.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>The event was held one week after Skeena candidates participated in a similar forum in Kitimat, hosted by the Kitimat Chamber of Commerce on Oct. 7.</p>\n<p><strong>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.northernsentinel.com/news/first-all-candidates-forum-for-snap-election-held-in-kitimat/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">First All-Candidates Forum for snap election held in Kitimat</a> </strong></p>\n<p>Candidates answered questions submitted by Skeena community members, the Terrace Chamber of Commerce, CFNR News and CFTK TV News.</p>\n<p>Topics for the event included the tourism industry during and after the pandemic, diversifying the economy, youth entrepreneurship, mental health supports, and systematic racism within the RCMP to name a few.</p>\n<p>One topic that garnered a fair amount of attention was whether the candidates were for or against the inland port train trans-loading facility being proposed for Terrace.</p>\n<p>Holzbauer said that he could see both sides to the argument. However, he said he couldn\u2019t make an informed choice \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 without reading up and doing more research on the proposal.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Halbauer said she did not feel she could answer \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 to the question, as it isn\u2019t her job to make that decision, but to listen and understand and support the needs and interests of the community.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019m confident that the City of Terrace will be, you know, taking all of this information in and our city councillors \u2014 who are elected to make this decision \u2014 will make the best decision possible for all community members,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Ross, however, said he was for it, as it would help provide jobs for those in Terrace who don\u2019t want to or are unable to travel to Kitimat or Prince Rupert or elsewhere, especially in the winter.</p>\n<p>Ross added that Kitimat has the tax base from local industry and Rupert has a tax base from ships and ports. However, Terrace is often stuck in the middle, getting the influx from both other cities but not always reaping all the same benefits, and that \u201cTerrace needs something to help subsidize their tax base.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another question involved what the candidates would do to address the growing tension and conflict between Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities that both rely on fish and wildlife species for social, cultural, food usage in a way that is fair and equitable.</p>\n<p>Halbauer said the community and stakeholders need to take a look at what is actually causing the salmon depletion in the area, and come together to collaborate and look at solutions that work for everyone.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re fishing deeper, we\u2019re fishing different species, we\u2019re disrupting the food chain,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of these things need to be addressed at an international level to ensure we have salmon stocks in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ross agreed that it\u2019s an international issue, and that local stakeholders need to come together to discuss and come up with a plan, as that\u2019s often the only way governments will listen and respond to a community\u2019s issue.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve actually got three user groups: we\u2019ve got the commercial fishermen, we\u2019ve got the sport fishermen, and we\u2019ve got the First Nation fishermen,\u201d he said, \u201cand we all fight for what\u2019s left after the international fishery takes its share.\u201d</p>\n<p>Holzbauer agreed with Ross and Halbauer\u2019s statements, and said that it\u2019s important to find the common ground between those who use the resources. He acknowledged that the fishing industry was a larger resource in the past, one that has diminished over the decades, and that it\u2019s absolutely something that needs to be addressed.</p>\n<p>The event ended with the candidates\u2019 closing statements, each promising to help Skeena if elected, in their own, personal way.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf the people of Skeena choose to elect me, I will do the best to represent them \u2014 all of them \u2014 but also I think diversity in not just jobs, local economy, but also within all of us is important,\u201d Holzbauer said. \u201cAnd like I said before, it makes the world a much more interesting place to live in.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ross concluded by emphasizing his focus on resource development and the economy, as well as the need to focus on mental health supports throughout the pandemic and going forward.</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe with a strong economy we can get those good-paying jobs for our region and take care of those who need it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn conclusion, I want to ask a question back to Skeena: what do you want Skeena to be?\u201d</p>\n<p>Halbauer said, if elected, she would work in collaboration with all community members and local stakeholders to make sure the issues addressed at the event, along with the others in her and BC NDP\u2019s platform, are dealt with as promised.</p>\n<p>\u201cI spent a lot of my life having my voice silenced, and I will not be a part of doing that to anybody else,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you have an issue, you can come to me. I\u2019m here to serve. I\u2019m here to work hard for you.\u201d</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:clare.rayment@northernsentinel.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/>clare.rayment@northernsentinel.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/kitimatnews\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kitimatnews\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",

    "content_html": "<p>These days, Jens Pillat favours a simple life.</p>\n<p>The 46-year-old used to be a firefighter in Germany before coming to B.C. to earn his helicopter pilot\u2019s licence. After several years of flying choppers, mostly in forestry, Pillat stepped away from that career to spend more time with his two daughters, who are 8 and 11 years old.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs a pilot, you\u2019re always in camp. You\u2019re always gone,\u201d he told <em>The Terrace Standard</em>.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Now Pillat owns and operates the Papa Jens donair truck, which can usually be found parked next to Kal Tire in Terrace. Pillat spent months renovating an old motor home to accommodate the donair business, which officially opened on Sept. 1.</p>\n<p>Pillat explained that donairs in Germany are usually different from donairs in Canada, and he wanted to bring that German style to Terrace.</p>\n<p>\u201cOver here it\u2019s usually a wrap,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] I bake my own bread, so it\u2019s more like a fluffy big sandwich.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pillat said he\u2019s not a professional cook.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not a chef, but I can make donairs I guess,\u201d he joked. \u201cI like to cook at home, but nothing fancy, more down to earth, like stew and schnitzel. My girls like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pillat said he likes to joke, though his German sense of humour might not always jive with Canadian senses of humour. He\u2019s already drawing plenty of laughs on social media for his outrageous, informal posts advertising the food truck. One such post featured a risque calendar photo of a muscled, shirtless firefighter \u2014 the post implied that you too could have such a body if you ate at the donair truck daily.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>But Pillat said he takes his work in the food truck very seriously.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything hygiene I don\u2019t joke around. I want everything clean and quality. That\u2019s my worst fear, like to put a bad donair out,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Pillat grew up in a small village near Frankfurt, Germany and he was a bit of a rascal as a teenager, he said. He started his working life as an apprentice cabinet maker. Then, he did a year of military service, which was compulsory for young German men at the time.</p>\n<p>While most wanted to fail the military intake medical exam, Pillat was eager to pass it and serve as a paratrooper. He aced the medical exam, but was promptly stationed in front of a typewriter for the logistics department. That was baffling to him, he said, because growing up he was always a handy guy who enjoyed wrenching and that type of work.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do they do? They put me in an office and give me a typewriter \u2026 Just put me on a truck or something, or a forklift,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the other guys that were really smart and knew all that [typing stuff], they [were] put on the trucks and on the forklifts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut that\u2019s typical military.\u201d</p>\n<p>He went on to work as a professional firefighter in Frankfurt for eight years. During that period, he took a year off and traveled around the world on his BMW motorcycle. The trip was inspired by an old tradition where young German journeymen take an epic hitchhiking journey, equipped with little more than the clothes on their backs, to visit different places to learn more about their trade.</p>\n<p>Pillat rode his motorbike through the Sahara desert, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, Norway and other places, visiting fire stations all along the way. He said he learned a lot during that trip and had plenty of wild experiences.</p>\n<p>In Australia, he reached into a fire hydrant to clear out some debris just like he would have done in Germany.</p>\n<p>\u201cI did that in Australia, I just wanted to reach in with my bare hands, and the other [firefighter] just kicked me out. \u2018There\u2019s a spider in there!\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>In Nevada, he had a rough time with the desert heat while he was bundled up in motorcycle riding gear, and the Las Vegas fire department took pity on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI spent three days there in Death Valley, and I come out just like a hillbilly, you know, not shaved, like I\u2019m done. And I knock on the door of the Las Vegas fire station [saying] \u2018Uhhh yeah, I\u2019m a German fireman \u2026\u2019\u201d he said with a chuckle.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey looked at me and said \u2018Come on in. We\u2019ll get you a shower and some food to eat.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>He first arrived in Canada after visiting New Zealand. His motorcycle was being shipped by boat and wouldn\u2019t arrive for weeks, so he spent that time hitchhiking around Vancouver Island.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe first impression is simply the size,\u201d he said of Canada. \u201cFor Germans or Europeans, we can\u2019t imagine the size.\u201d</p>\n<p>After his bike arrived and he traveled to northern B.C., he began to appreciate the freedom that the open spaces allow. He could simply park his bike and camp next to a creek somewhere.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t even be allowed to do that in Germany. Everything would be private property,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>In Alaska, he met a German helicopter pilot who let him stay in the hangar for a night.

The owners are legally required to replace the underground gas tanks within five years, but the owners have indicated they don\u2019t intend to undertake such a costly renovation, said David Block, the City\u2019s director of development services.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Instead, the owners want to lease a portion of the existing building (which is mostly unused by Copperside Foods at this point) to a craft distillery company. The distillery and gas bar would co-exist at the location until the gas station reaches the end of its lifespan, at which point the distillery would take over the location with the convenience store shrinking in size.</p>\n<p>The City\u2019s zoning bylaw currently permits craft distilleries on properties zoned as downtown commercial, but not on properties zoned as neighbourhood commercial, which is the zone the gas station falls under. Therefore, the first step in the development process is a site-specific amendment to the City\u2019s zoning bylaw to allow a craft distillery at that location.</p>\n<p>Block said City staff recommended granting the site-specific amendment because the gas station property is right at the edge of downtown.</p>\n<p>Council discussed a number of potential issues with the proposed craft distillery, such as parking limitations and the building\u2019s proximity to George Little Park where children often play, but ultimately decided to pass first and second readings of the proposed amendment.</p>\n<p>Councillor Brian Downie voted against first and second readings, saying there are too many issues with the location.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy perspective would be that this is not an appropriate use in that location,\u201d he said. \u201cAnother location, the co-op property for instance, it would be a completely valid use, but not adjacent to a premiere park in the City of Terrace.\u201d</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Councillor Evan Ramsay said he also had some concerns with the proposal, but he voted in favour of first and second readings because that would allow the proposed amendment to be circulated to the public for comment and it would allow for a public hearing.

The developer, Progressive Ventures, held a physical open house July 29 and a virtual, online open house for the first two weeks of August. The developer was also required to conduct a traffic impact study.</p>\n<p>A summary of Progressive Ventures\u2019 public input initiative and the traffic study will be presented at council\u2019s Sept. 28 meeting, said Tara Irwin, city planner, as well as a revision to second reading of the proposed amendments to the official community plan, (specifically regarding the Keith Estates Neighbourhood Concept plan.)</p>\n<p>The Keith Estates Neighbourhood Concept plan, which was drafted in 2014, is a subsection of Terrace\u2019s official community plan that envisions the former mill site as a mixed-use residential and commercial area. The Keith Estates Neighbourhood Concept plan will need to be significantly altered to accommodate the proposed inland port development.</p>\n<p>Following the Sept. 28 meeting, the proposed amendments must then be referred to third-party groups for consultation, such as local First Nations, Northern Health, the Regional District of Kitimat-Stikine and others.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>That referral process that will take at least a month. During that month-long period, the City is also considering hosting a City-led open house, Irwin said, but details have yet to be finalized.</p>\n<p>Once the referrals are complete, the project proposal will then come back to council for a public hearing (which would encapsulate public feedback received by the City as well as the feedback collected by Progressive Ventures.) The City\u2019s public hearing could be as early as Oct. 26, Irwin said, but it may not happen until November, depending on how long the third-party referral takes.</p>\n<p>Council will absorb all that feedback at the public hearing and then, at a council meeting immediately following the public hearing, council will vote on third reading of the proposed amendments. Council will have the option to deny the proposed amendments, approve the proposed amendments, or direct City staff to further revise the proposed amendments.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",

What is that?\u2019 It\u2019s a deep adherence to nature and natural law, and attention to the cycles of the Earth and the lives within it,\u201d Blackett told <em>The Terrace Standard</em>. \u201cWe work in love and light.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blackett said witches have been oppressed for hundreds of years because their beliefs threatened mainstream religious teachings.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut we\u2019re back,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen are invoking the witch to find their power in a patriarchal society.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blackett explained that there is a formal religion built on the values of witchcraft, called Wicca, but not all witches are Wiccan and not all Wiccans are witches. She said she doesn\u2019t necessarily consider herself a Wiccan, but her shop is there to support Wiccans (and any other religion, for that matter.)</p>\n<p>\u201cWicca is an actual religion, and it is the fastest growing faith right now in North America, and pretty much the world at this point,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are definitely in a state right now of the awakening. Everybody\u2019s feelin\u2019 it. The Earth is really waking up and there\u2019s big changes and a lot of people are diving into their spirituality, whether it\u2019s Buddhist, Christian or Wiccan, it doesn\u2019t really matter. The shop is here for that purpose. I mean, you can be a Jedi, I don\u2019t care. We\u2019re going to help you find the Force.\u201d</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>One way the shop could help a person, Blackett said, would be to help them find a crystal with vibrations that really speak to that person, helping them feel spiritually at peace. The shop also sells sage for smudging, which can help get rid of negative vibrations.</p>\n<p>The shop also offers workshops. In 2019, Blackett hosted a women\u2019s retreat that included yoga, meditation, music, dance, and herbalism, among many other activities. She said it was incredibly rewarding to host it and she hopes to do another soon.</p>\n<p>\u201cHelping women is a very big thing for me,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Blackett was born and raised in the Smithers area, where she lived for many years before moving to Terrace. She raised three boys, who are now 29, 27, and 25 years old. She worked for about 17 years doing deliveries for Canada Post in rural areas around Smithers.</p>\n<p>Throughout that whole time, she was discovering her psychic talent. She said she was around 8 when she first sensed that she was channeling energies and spirits around her, but she didn\u2019t have a full understanding of what was happening at the time. As a teenager, she sort of lost connection with those senses.</p>\n<p>She became an avid traveler in her early 20s, and on a trip to Europe she had a sudden reconnection with her psychic abilities.</p>\n<p>She was standing on the wall of the Tower of London in England.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was when my first experience happened, big time. I had a past life there, apparently, and I died there,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>She heard a cacophony of voices of the dead. It was like the sound of a party in the background of a phone call, she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy sister had to pretty much pull me out of there, and I could just hear them getting angrier and angrier because I wasn\u2019t understanding what they were doing,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Upon returning to Smithers, she had another flash of the past life in England. She was riding in a car with her then-husband, a friend, and her oldest boy, when suddenly she was in the back of a horse-drawn carriage.</p>\n<p>After the second flash, she sought the guidance of a more experienced medium who helped her understand what she was seeing.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure enough, I was in the peasants revolt. I was a woman at that time, with a bunch of men traveling by boat to go see the king, the young boy king. If he sees us, they\u2019ll listen to us. And they threw me in a pit with my comrades from my village, and we were left to die there. And [I] died there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Over time, she learned to protect herself from dark visions of the past and to better manage her abilities.</p>\n<p>She started doing psychic readings for people she knew, eventually setting up a room in her home to perform the ceremonies. Interest in her services grew and grew, until finally, nine years ago, she officially opened up a shop offering related goods and services in Smithers.</p>\n<p>Several years after opening her shop in Smithers, Blackett met her now-partner, who is from Terrace, through a dating site. When she first met him she was very impressed, but scared too. Dating can be tough, she said, when you have to tell prospective partners that you\u2019re a witch and a psychic. But he was totally accepting. The two quickly became close, and she decided to move from Smithers to Terrace four years ago.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a big decision. Smithers is my home, everybody\u2019s there,\u201d she said, noting that the community in Terrace has been extremely welcoming to her.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis has been such a wonderful, wonderful area to grow my business and meet new friends and opportunities \u2026 And the merchants have been awesome, just wonderful.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blackett said in all her years of running her shop, both in Smithers and in Terrace, no one has openly expressed hate toward her for her beliefs or lifestyle.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt really is no worries to me if you don\u2019t believe me or anything. That\u2019s okay. That\u2019s totally fine. You\u2019re just not where we are yet,\u201d she said.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",

    "content_html": "<p>Taylor Bachrach, NDP MP for Skeena \u2014 Bulkley Valley, says workers\u2019 rights and income inequality are at the front of his mind as the federal government enters a pivotal moment.</p>\n<p>Bachrach sat down for a phone call with <em>The Terrace Standard </em>to talk labour issues ahead of Labour Day Sept. 7, less than a month before Parliament is set to resume with the minority Liberal government possibly facing a vote of confidence that could trigger an early election. Bachrach and the NDP are in a strong position to influence policy because they have enough seats to carry the Liberals through a vote of confidence, even if the rest of Parliament votes to bring the Trudeau government down.</p>\n<p>Bachrach said one of the major issues facing workers in his riding is a problem seen across the country; front-line workers, such as grocery clerks, are underpaid and disrespected.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cThe front-line essential workers, whose jobs are often undervalued in our society, are, in fact, essential to keeping our society running,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, many of them are poorly compensated, and my hope is that our experience in the pandemic will cause us, as a society, to rethink how we value different roles in our community.\u201d</p>\n<p>When asked if he had any words for people in his riding who are struggling or afraid because of the pandemic, Bachrach said the crisis provides an opportunity to usher in broad societal and economic change.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want them to know that we\u2019ve got their backs and that we\u2019re going to work to make sure that they not only have the help they need in the short term to get through this unprecedented time, but that long-term we\u2019re going to fight for a recovery from the pandemic that includes them, and that their needs as workers aren\u2019t going to be forgotten,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the biggest challenges facing our country is economic inequality, and the fact that a very small number of Canadians are doing better and better all the time, while the gap between those that are doing very well and those that are struggling to get by continues to widen. That\u2019s a problem that\u2019s widely recognized as being bad for society.\u201d</p>\n<p>The NDP would address income inequality in part by closing tax-haven loopholes and taxing wealthy Canadians.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe ordinary, everyday working resident of the Northwest is paying their taxes and contributing to the greater good, and unfortunately the system has been set up in such a way that there are a handful of people taking huge advantage of it,\u201d he said.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Bachrach is known in his riding as an environmentalist, but he said his goal of fighting climate change is not at odds with fostering the resource-based economy upon which many workers in his riding rely.</p>\n<p>\u201cFighting climate change means that we are going to re-tool many aspects of our society and our communities, and that re-tooling requires raw resources and skilled labour,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look at the forest industry and the role that wood products can play moving forward, you look at the mining industry and the role that metals like copper are going to play as we move to electrify parts of the economy that have been fueled by fossil fuels, those are going to remain important, so I don\u2019t buy into the notion that natural resource industries are at odds with climate action.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe needs of [resource economy] workers can\u2019t be overlooked, and more than anything in our region, we need to look to build an economy in the future that is stable and resilient, where we can to try to buffer against the boom and bust cycles that have so dramatically affected our communities in the past, and in doing so we help create the stability for workers and their families that everyone wants.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bachrach was elected in last fall\u2019s federal election, replacing New Democrat Nathan Cullen who decided not to run again.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",

    "content_html": "<p>The City of Terrace is spending $25,000 to upgrade audio/video technology in council chambers.</p>\n<p>Council has relied heavily on streaming and conference calling to conduct its business while maintaining physical distancing since the pandemic began. During regular council meetings, usually only the mayor, two councillors and a handful of other participants such as City staff or media are physically present in council chambers. The remaining councillors participate by audio-only conference calls, as do some delegations and presenters.</p>\n<p>Because there is limited room for public attendance in council chambers, the City has taken to livestreaming all of its public meetings.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Currently council chambers are outfitted with a microphone for each seat at the council table and one fixed-view camera that oversees the chambers. The camera has begun to break down and recent livestreams of council meetings have been limited to audio-only.</p>\n<p>The proposed upgrades will add new cameras to improve the video feed from council chambers, resulting in superior livestreams of meetings and superior video calls from chambers to outside sources. Additionally, the upgrades will result in the ability to display incoming video feeds on a projector in council chambers, meaning the chambers will be fully capable of video-conferencing. This will allow councillors participating remotely to show video, whereas they are currently limited to audio.</p>\n<p>Council is preparing to participate in the Union of B.C. Municipalities Convention (UBCM) \u2014 a crucial annual meeting that, among other things, provides an opportunity for municipal politicians to meet with Provincial ministers \u2014 which will be held virtually for the first time this year, from Sept. 22 to Sept. 24. Video-conferencing capabilities will allow council richer participation in the conference.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe would like to get started on this project immediately, with the hope of having conferencing capabilities prior to the UBCM meetings,\u201d said Lori Greenlaw, finance director, to council in a meeting seeking approval for the upgrade project.</p>\n<p>The primary components of the upgrade will be two new cameras in council chambers, said Dylan Powell, the City\u2019s information systems manager. The new cameras will be able to pan, tilt and zoom, unlike the current fixed-view camera, and those movements can be automated to focus a camera on whomever is speaking in council chambers. One camera will be aimed toward the table where council sits, and another camera will be mounted behind where council sits, facing toward the area where presenters and delegations sit.</p>\n<p>The City will also purchase two video encoder/decoders, which are essentially computers specifically for processing video information. One will be placed in council chambers to quarterback the video feeds from the two new cameras, while the other will be placed in a room downstairs at City Hall that is used as overflow seating for council chambers. Having that encoder/decoder downstairs will allow for a nearly instantaneous video feed from council chambers to the overflow room, whereas currently there is a significant delay, Powell said.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>The microphones in council chambers are still good and will not be replaced. However, an audio amplifier \u2014 a box which is the central point for audio equipment in the room \u2014 will be replaced. Powell said the new amplifier will allow him to optimize the setup of audio equipment in council chambers, possibly reducing feedback, and it will allow him much more flexibility in how he arranges audio equipment within the building.</p>\n<p>The cameras, the encoder/decoders, and the audio system currently installed in chambers are all part of an enterprise software and hardware ecosystem called Q-SYS, offered by the company QSC. (A well-known example of a consumer-grade hardware and software ecosytem is offered by Apple Inc. \u2014 if you own a Mac computer and an iPhone, they tend to play nicely with one another.)</p>\n<p>Powell said it makes sense to have the cameras and encoders/decoders match the existing audio system, and he prefers the Q-SYS ecosystem over competing enterprise ecosystems because it is very flexible and it will allow him to set the system up in such a way that it can be operated easily by less-technically-savvy individuals.</p>\n<p>\u201dIt gives me the ability to make available to the end-user only what they need to see, so I can do as much as I want in the background, and only expose what really matters to whoever needs to manage the room audio or anything like that,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Each camera will cost about $4,500, each video encoder/decoder will cost about $2,000, and the audio amplifier will cost about $2,500, Powell said. The remainder of the $25,000 total cost will go toward supplementary items such as cables to connect the equipment.</p>\n<p>The equipment is expensive, Powell said, but sticking to the Q-SYS ecosystem will save quite a bit of time and effort.</p>\n<p>\u201c[The price] is admittedly very steep, but the amount of administrative overhead is relatively low, which adds value, because that\u2019s time I don\u2019t have to spend working on it,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Funding for the upgrade will likely come from the City\u2019s Northern Capital and Planning Grant Reserve fund, Greenlaw said, but the City\u2019s grant writer is investigating potential funding sources from higher levels of government.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",

    "content_html": "<p>Below is a summary of key discussions from the regular Terrace city council meeting held Aug. 10.</p>\n<p><strong>Court watch loses momentum</strong></p>\n<p>Council\u2019s court watch initiative hit a snag.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>At the previous council meeting, on July 28, council decided to reach out to Coast Mountain College\u2019s criminology program to see if its students would volunteer to sit in on court proceedings and report back to council.</p>\n<p>At the Aug. 10 meeting, Councillor Sean Bujtas said Coast Mountain College indicated they are not interested in participating.</p>\n<p>Bujtas said he felt now is the wrong time to go ahead with establishing a court watch, because it\u2019s not clear what exactly council wants from the initiative and because he was concerned about asking volunteers to sit in a closed space during the pandemic. Councillor Brian Downie echoed those sentiments.</p>\n<p>But councillor James Cordeiro said there is a clear objective for the initiative.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe purpose is to have a council-sanctioned public presence in the courts so that we have the opportunity for that group to report to us any concerns they have on behalf of the public,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Councillor Lynne Christiansen said council promised the public they would create a court watch committee and they should follow through.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Council opted to proceed with creating a court watch committee, voting to instruct City staff to search for volunteers for the committee. However, council did not specify when that search should take place, with several councillors suggesting staff should wait until after the pandemic to advertise. Councillors Downie and Bujtas were opposed to that motion. Councillors Christiansen, Cordeiro and Evan Ramsay were in favour. Councillor Jessica McCallum-Miller was not present at the meeting.</p>\n<p><strong>Rezoning halted at 5008 Agar Ave.</strong></p>\n<p>Earlier this year, council agreed in principle to allow the north half of 5008 Agar Ave. to be rezoned from commercial to light industrial, but after receiving a request to reconsider from neighbouring property owners, council opted for a different course of action.</p>\n<p>The property was recently purchased by Westland Resources, a forestry consulting company, which plans to use the north half of the lot to expand its business (the south half is home to the former Misty River Tackle, Hunting &amp; Archery building).</p>\n<p>At the time, city staff recommended rezoning the north half to light industrial because that is the zone that allows for technical consulting firms such as Westland Resources. Several adjacent property owners indicated support for the rezoning.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, the City received correspondence from neighbouring property owners who essentially approved of Westland Resources\u2019 planned use for the property, but were concerned that rezoning to light industrial would open the door to more intrusive industrial uses (if the property were sold to a different company, for example).</p>\n<p>City Planner Tara Irwin said an alternative would be to keep the property zoned commercial, but create a site-specific exemption that allowed trade contracting and technical consulting firms, which are normally restricted to industrial properties.</p>\n<p>Council opted to pursue that alternative.</p>\n<p><strong>New shed at Heritage Park Museum</strong></p>\n<p>Anna Glass, curator of Heritage Park Museum, appeared before council seeking permission to construct a storage shed at the museum.</p>\n<p>The museum grounds may be large, Glass said, but it lacks storage space, resulting in things like gardening tools being stored alongside museum artifacts.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause our storage spaces are filled with operational items, some of our artifacts do not have adequate room for storage, which can lead to the decomposition of these artifacts,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Glass said she and the museum board had originally planned to purchase and install a pre-fabricated shed, but that would be in sharp contrast to the many historical wood buildings on the museum grounds. Instead, they plan to build a shed with cedar siding to match the other buildings. Council approved the building of a new shed. Details such as the size of the shed and cost estimates are yet to be determined and will be presented to City staff for final approval before construction. Funding for the project will come from the museum\u2019s capital projects budget and will be completed in stages.</p>\n<p><strong>Debate continues about food truck regulations</strong></p>\n<p>Currently, food trucks are limited to parking four hours on public property.</p>\n<p>Changes to the time limit had previously been discussed at the May 25 council meeting, when staff recommended increasing the time limit to six hours (among several other amendments to food truck rules.) But council asked staff at that time to further revise the recommended changes.</p>\n<p>At the most recent meeting, Irwin proposed increasing the time limit to five hours, so food truck operators could have half an hour at either end of the time window for setup and teardown.</p>\n<p>Additionally, she proposed setting a noise level limit of 65 dB for generators on the food trucks. She said she didn\u2019t expect bylaw officers to actively enforce this limit, but it would provide an objective limit in case the City received a noise complaint about a food truck.</p>\n<p>But Councillor Brian Downie expressed doubt that 65 dB was a reasonable limit, saying some diesel generators could be as loud as 80 dB. Councillor James Cordeiro agreed, pointing out that noise from moving vehicles is often much louder than 65 dB. Council asked staff to further revise the propose regulation changes and the matter will be discussed again.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",

Police executed search warrants on Edwardsen\u2019s house on Old Lakelse Lake Rd. and several other residences connected with Edwardsen. They found significant quantities of cocaine, ecstasy, magic mushrooms and cannabis. They also seized several handguns and 110 long guns from the properties.</p>\n<p>Although Edwardsen was initially arrested in 2012, his trial didn\u2019t begin in earnest until 2017, and he spent much of that time out of custody on bail. He was convicted of the 14 charges in 2017 and in 2018 he was sentenced to eight years in jail, minus 389 days for time already served.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Now, he has been granted full parole.</p>\n<p><em>The Terrace Standard</em> has obtained a document from the Parole Board of Canada outlining the reasons for granting Edwardsen full parole.</p>\n<p>The document states that Edwardsen was initially released on day parole in January 2020 and placed in a halfway house in south-central B.C. as part of a gradual return to the community. The parole board found that Edwardsen did not breach any of the conditions of his release during six months of day parole.</p>\n<p>\u201dYou have not been suspected of breach behaviours or an increase in risk, but you are noted as behaving in a rude and disrespectful way to staff,\u201d the document states.</p>\n<p>The parole board indicated that money was Edwardsen\u2019s primary motivation for his criminal activity, and they found that Edwardsen has been committed to earning money through legal employment during his years on bail and his time on day parole.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have demonstrated over this time that you are committed to earning a living through legitimate means, you appear motivated to continue to do this,\u201d the document states. \u201cThe Board is in receipt of your submissions regarding employment. You have offers of employment in diamond drilling, longshore work, and contracting.\u201d</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cThe Board has placed significant weight on this.\u201d</p>\n<p>The parole board placed two conditions on Edwardsen\u2019s release: he is prohibited from associating with anyone involved in criminal activity or substance abuse, and he is required to provide ongoing financial information to his parole supervisor. (He is also prohibited from owning firearms for 10 years, a condition placed upon him when he was sentenced in 2018.)</p>\n<p>However, the parole board also found lingering issues with Edwardsen\u2019s attitude.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were engaged in a high level drug trafficking business and you have a significant criminal history, with very minimal insight into why you chose to engage in these activities,\u201d the document states. \u201cThe Board finds that you do behave with a sense of entitlement and that your attitudes are directly connected to your crime for gain behaviour. These attitudes appear to continue in your interactions with staff, and this is a concern.\u201d</p>\n<p>The document notes that Edwardsen had a significant criminal history prior to the drug and firearm convictions, including assault convictions in 1980, 1984, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996 and 1997.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen asked about why you have such a significant criminal record, you said that you were young, living in the north, drinking a lot, and that\u2019s <strong>\u2018</strong>how it was in the \u201980s,\u2019\u201d the document states. \u201cYou said that you will still drink \u2018a beer\u2019 with a meal, but that you don\u2019t spend long hours in a bar like you used to and haven\u2019t for many years. The Board finds that you have extremely limited insight into the factors that led to your criminal offending.\u201d</p>\n<p>The document is partially redacted and contains no mention of Edwardsen\u2019s current location or where he plans to reside once he\u2019s on full parole.</p>\n<p><em>\u2013 with files from Quinn Bender and Margaret Speirs</em></p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",

    "content_html": "<p>The Terrace Fire Department has a shiny new rescue truck.</p>\n<p>The $760,000 vehicle was purchased using a $500,000 donation from LNG Canada, with the City covering the rest of the bill.</p>\n<p>Unlike a fire engine, the new rescue truck will not carry water, said Deputy Fire Chief Dave Jephson.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cWe\u2019re calling this a rescue truck, highway rescue because it responds the bulk of the time to motor vehicle accidents outside of Terrace, but it also responds to motor vehicle accidents in Terrace,\u201d he said, adding that the truck could also be used in other scenarios such as basic water rescues or hazmat situations. \u201cObviously we have great staff, their roles and responsibility are huge. This gives them another option to respond with different types of tools, different things that are needed either on the fire ground, or rescue.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The truck could also be used at fires as a support vehicle.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe use it for rehab, so at a larger fire we start taking the blood pressure of all our members to make sure that they\u2019re safe and working within certain criteria. Winter time, we need shelter to go and thaw their packs and thaw their gear out,\u201d Jephson said.</p>\n<p>The brand of the truck is E-ONE, a company the Terrace Fire Department has done business with in the past with great results, Jephson said. He noted one advantage of buying this truck is that it is built completely by E-ONE instead of being assembled by multiple companies, which means the warranty will be reliable.</p>\n<p>\u201c[E-ONE] can look after that [warranty]. They can\u2019t blame it on another customer or somebody else adding to it,\u201d he said.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Mayor Carol Leclerc said that when LNG Canada offered to make a large donation, it was councillor Brian Downie who had the idea to put the money toward a new rescue truck. Leclerc thanked LNG Canada for the contribution.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen LNG Canada came up, stepped up to the plate, this just made things that much easier for us. $500,000 in the City budget is huge. Like that\u2019s half of a road construction job,\u201d she said. \u201cA huge thank-you to LNG Canada for recognizing the impact that this project will have in the Northwest \u2026 It\u2019s nice to have industry partners that come and help with municipal projects.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jennifer Prochera, a senior community engagement advisor with LNG Canada, said the company recognizes its project will bring a lot of traffic to the highway between Terrace and Kitimat, so a highway rescue vehicle is a \u201cwin-win\u201d for the company and the communities.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn construction phase, we\u2019re going to have up to 7,000 in and out of the Terrace airport and into Kitimat, so the highway is going to be busy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe like to think that we\u2019re going to leave the communities better than they were when we got here.\u201d</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",

    "content_html": "<p>People who survived abuse at federal Indian day schools may need their communities\u2019 support in submitting claims for compensation.</p>\n<p>Day schools were similar to residential schools, except they were typically situated close to Indigenous communities and the children forced to attend were able to return home at the end of each day. Nevertheless, day schools and residential schools generally shared the goal of assimilating children and destroying First Nations languages and cultures.</p>\n<p>A class-action lawsuit against the federal government on behalf of survivors of abuse at the day schools was launched in 2009, and a settlement was reached last year. Now, survivors can file a claim to receive a portion of the settlement; from $10,000 to $200,000, depending on the abuse they faced.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>The application form required to submit a claim is rigorous, covering painful, difficult subject matter while requiring extensive supporting documents and materials. This is a huge barrier to many potential claimants, said Brin Friend, a program co-ordinator with the Terrace Women\u2019s Resource Centre Society who has helped three people complete the application form.</p>\n<p>The form divides emotional, physical and sexual abuse into five levels of severity, and then associates a settlement dollar value to each level ($50,000 for level 3, $100,000 for level 4, etc.). Higher levels require more supporting documentation, such as names and positions of abusers, medical or dental records, and evidence of school attendance.</p>\n<p>But many applicants don\u2019t have access to that kind supporting documentation, Friend said.</p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of individuals didn\u2019t keep documentation because it wasn\u2019t part of their cultural upbringing, they weren\u2019t aware that it was going to be important, or they fled in a state of emergency so they didn\u2019t have time to bring it with them,\u201d she said. \u201cSome individuals just never received that information.\u201d</p>\n<p>The application form does contain another option if applicants don\u2019t have all the required documentation: instead, they can have the form signed by a professional guarantor such as a notary public, an elected official, or another professional such as a doctor or lawyer. Most of those professions typically charge a fee to sign any documents, and cost can also be a barrier for applicants, Friend said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe elected official technically is the cheapest because they don\u2019t have a mandate to have to charge people [for services],\u201d she said.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>That\u2019s why she enlisted the help of Taylor Bachrach, MP for Skeena\u2014Bulkley Valley, in completing the three applications she has worked on thus far. Bachrach signed the three applications at the Terrace Women\u2019s Resource Centre on July 22.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a real honour,\u201d he said. \u201cThe settlement is a step that\u2019s long overdue, and an important part of reconciliation \u2026 if there\u2019s a small role that I can play in removing barriers to claimants participating in the process and getting settlements, then, like I said, it\u2019s an honour to be part of.\u201d</p>\n<p>Friend said she reached out to other local elected officials, none of whom committed to assisting on the applications, though she noted that none refused to help either.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had, I wouldn\u2019t say an outright \u2018no,\u2019 but maybe a lack of comfort, or a few individuals who have said they will get back to us because they\u2019re not sure if they\u2019re qualified and they would like to check on their own, rather than just taking my word for it and I totally respect that,\u201d she said, adding that it is ironic that Bachrach was the one who did help, considering he lives in Smithers and is the \u201cleast local\u201d elected official she reached out to.</p>\n<p>The form states that any elected official can act as guarantor, including elected members of First Nations governments.</p>\n<p>Friend first learned about the claim application form when one of the Terrace Women\u2019s Resource Centre\u2019s regular clients asked for help with the form. The Centre regularly provides literacy assistance.</p>\n<p>\u201cLiteracy is a barrier for many of the applicants of this process,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>The claim application process will be open until July 13, 2022. Friend said she has already received another inquiry from someone wanting assistance with the application form and she believes there will be even more people in the community who need assistance \u2014 more than the Terrace Women\u2019s Resource Centre will be able to help, even though they wish they could.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyone can come in and access our services,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are here to help, but plates all around are very full.\u201d</p>\n<p>She said she has reached out to other organizations that assist community members and offered to advise workers at those organizations.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter what sort of area they\u2019re operating from, but we\u2019re willing to support workers and help teach other community members how to support people in the [day school claim] process,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would like to see more trauma-informed practitioners, more counsellors or clinicians, people who have that front-line essential service training, it would be nice to see them supporting individuals in the process.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gowling WLG, the law firm administrating the claims process, was offering in-community assistance sessions earlier this year, but it cancelled the remaining physical sessions when the pandemic struck and instead is offering Zoom sessions. More information on the Zoom sessions can be found at <a href=\"https://indiandayschools.com/en/contact/presentations/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">indiandayschools.com/en/contact/presentations/</a></p>\n<p>Friend said that she may seek out additional training for herself if she feels her assistance role growing larger.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is a scary process. It is an intense process. I myself, if I\u2019m going to take this on in a more major capacity, feel that I need more training. It\u2019s a huge thing, on so many levels,\u201d she said.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",

    "content_html": "<p>After years of planning, a commemoration and healing totem pole honouring missing and murdered Indigenous women will be raised at a highway pullout on Kitsumkalum territory west of Terrace in September.</p>\n<p>The totem pole is not just for missing and murdered Indigenous women \u2014 in a way, it\u2019s also for missing and murdered people of all ages, colours and genders, as well as for two-spirit and LGBTQ people. That\u2019s because totem poles represent fluid, metaphorical ideas and should not be interpreted in direct, concrete terms, said Mike Dangeli, the lead artist carving the totem pole.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe reading isn\u2019t necessarily \u2018this means this\u2019 or \u2018this equals this\u2019 like in the English language,\u201d he said.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Arlene Roberts, who is a key organizer of the memorial totem pole and Dangeli\u2019s mom, said the physical monument is less important than the message it sends.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to have the courage and step forward in saying \u2018No more. No more stolen sisters.\u2019 It\u2019s time to make a cultural statement, a traditional statement,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about is honouring the families, and it\u2019s treasuring the souls and spirits of the stolen sisters and boys and men, it\u2019s honouring the two-spirited LGBTQ \u2026 and they\u2019re not just First Nations. There are non-First-Nations who are going missing as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>The idea to create a memorial came from Gladys Radek, a local advocate for missing and murdered Indigenous women. After her niece Tamara Chipman disappeared near Prince Rupert in 2005, Radek started organizing awareness walks \u2014 including a walk from Vancouver to Prince Rupert, and a walk across Canada. Eventually, Radek became involved with the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls as an advisor and as an advocate for families coming forward to share stories.</p>\n<p>During all that hard work that began years ago with awareness walks, she said, she always envisioned creating a memorial for families in the Northwest.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is kind of closing the circle for me from the walks,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted a space where our families could go, to find a little bit of healing, a little bit of peace, and a little bit of honouring their loved ones.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dangeli, an artist with Nisga\u2019a, Tsimshian, Tlingit and Tsetsaut heritage, has been working on the totem pole under a tent in his back yard on Terrace\u2019s Southside since September, alongside his adult sons Michael Dangeli and Nick Dangeli. He\u2019s carved more than 20 totem poles but never one so close to home in the Northwest, he said.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>The 24-foot totem pole is is not fully carved yet, but some of the figures are starting to take shape. Dangeli pointed out the main and largest figure on the totem pole, a young woman who will have a red dress and face paint. She will represent missing and murdered indigenous women. Above her is a matriarch figure. The bottom figure, which is a crucial figure because it bears the weight of the totem pole, is a killer whale, to acknowledge that the totem pole will be on Kitsumkalum killer whale clan territory. Many other figures will adorn the totem pole when it is ready.</p>\n<p>Originally the totem pole was meant to be completed in time for a June 5 raising ceremony, but the ceremony was postponed until September because of the pandemic. That was fortunate, Dangeli said, because it allowed the artistic team to slow down their timeline and work with extra care.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause of the energy and the subject matter, it\u2019s really important that we get it done right,\u201d he said. \u201cMy sons, before we even touched it in the raw log form, I took them out on the Skeena River, and we did ritual bathing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen it was just still a log but shaped out to be a pole \u2026 We had the kids come down and sweep it with cedar boughs, and again, water from the Skeena, just to bless it and we had elders and chiefs and matriarchs come down to just get it in a good way.\u201d</p>\n<p>The raising ceremony will take place Sept. 4 and Sept. 5 in what Dangeli called a \u201cvirtual potlatch\u201d to accommodate pandemic precaution measures.</p>\n<p>The totem pole will be raised on Sept. 4, and the following day dancers, chiefs and matriarchs will breath life into the totem pole.</p>\n<p>Only a small group of people will be physically present at any given time, but the event will be live-streamed by CFNR so anyone can participate from home.</p>\n<p>The memorial totem pole project has received plenty of funding and other support, Roberts said.</p>\n<p>She is grateful to co-organizers Marc Snelling and Wanda Good, as well as Highway of Tears families, friends and walkers, the Indian Residential School Survivors Society (where she also works), Kitsumkalum chiefs and matriarchs, Women and Gender Equality Canada, and B.C.\u2019s ministry of transportation.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve just had some incredible people coming along the line and saying, \u2018What can we do?

    "content_html": "<p>Kitselas elder Mel Bevan, 79, has had a long, illustrious career in politics, management and community building. Now he is settling in to reflect and write about his experiences.</p>\n<p>Bevan has done plenty of work in national politics, including as a campaign co-chair for Phil Fontaine, who was National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations from 2003 to 2009. Bevan was part of the group that created Canada\u2019s First Nations Fiscal Management Act, he helped establish the Centre for First Nations Governance and he assisted with a review of land management policy at Canada\u2019s former Department of Indian Affairs.</p>\n<p>He has also done much work provincially and locally. Bevan was instrumental in the creation of Canada\u2019s First Nations Radio (CFNR) and he helped establish two legal service centres in the Northwest.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>He also served as chief negotiator for Kitselas First Nation during self-governance negotiations that lead to an agreement-in-principle between Kitselas, the provincial government and the federal government, paving the way for a formal treaty (which is still in the works).</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much more I can do, other than maybe write stuff, maybe record things that people can read,\u201d Bevan told <em>The Terrace Standard</em>.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s now working on a book that contains lessons he\u2019s learned in his decades of work with First Nations across the country, with a focus on the shortcomings of the reserve system.</p>\n<p>Bevan said that many of the projects he\u2019s worked on over the years, including the legal service centres he helped set up and an Indigenous housing program he worked on through the Kermode Friendship Society, have been changed from independent, Indigenous-led projects into provincial or federal government programs.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll the work I\u2019ve done over the years, all the things we\u2019ve managed to do, the big problem is trying to make it permanent,\u201d he said. \u201cNative people are not part of the fabric of Canada. We\u2019re outside the fabric of Canada, right, so if you get a sympathetic government you can get things like social housing or law centres, things like that, but if the government turns unsympathetic, it just disappears, and that happens to everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only thing that actually stays permanent is people on reserves that suffer from this.\u201d</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Bevan said that in his writing he also hopes to continue to record some of his knowledge of Sm\u2019algyax, his first language and the language of the Tsimshian people. The language has changed significantly since he was a boy, becoming fused with the English language, Bevan said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe old meaning is disappearing, once people like me [go,] and there\u2019s not too many of us left,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen people learn it today, they\u2019re basically speaking English.\u201d</p>\n<p>He gave the example of a Sm\u2019algyax word that today is translated to the English word \u2018chair.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201cExcept they never had chairs, all it really means a top, something to sit on. Could be a rock, or a stump, or a log, or a cedar mat,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are the meanings that have disappeared.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy point there wasn\u2019t to change what is taught now. You can\u2019t change it. I just wanted to record the old language.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sm\u2019algyax suffered a blow because of Canadian government assimilation tactics, Bevan said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey tried to beat it out of us in school, our language, wouldn\u2019t allow us to speak it. People got strapped if they spoke their language, but we always spoke it at home. My grandmother never spoke a word of English. Nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe pretended we were conforming.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bevan said he hasn\u2019t really spoken old-style Sm\u2019algyax since his mother died almost 50 years ago.</p>\n<p>In addition to writing, Bevan plans to take this summer off, to be \u201clazy,\u201d he said with a laugh.</p>\n<p>The break is well-deserved. Bevan has been working ever since he was a young man.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere was no such thing as a teenager back then,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Bevan started his working life at a local mill.</p>\n<p>\u201cMainly I worked in sawmills, I spent 10 years in Skeena Forest Products. I started out as a labourer, and ended up being a shift supervisor. I ran the mill at night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Back then it was hard for Indigenous people to find work because they were not accepted by mainstream society, Bevan said. But the late Bill McRae, who managed Skeena Sawmills for decades, would readily hire Indigenous people to work at the mill.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe grew up amongst native people. He hired all the native people, so there was a whole bunch of us that worked there, native people from all over,\u201d Bevan said. \u201cHe helped a lot of people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Working at the mill was just one way that Bevan started to build a network that would eventually lead to his later career in management and politics.</p>\n<p>Prior to working at the mill, Bevan spent a year in hospital after contracting tuberculosis, from 1956 to 1957. He was fortunate to receive treatment for his tuberculosis.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was actually lucky, if you want to call it that. The people that got it before me, say a few years before me, there was [no treatment,] so they mainly just died,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>It was an all-Indigenous hospital where he made many friends.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe reason Indian hospitals came into existence was the Province wouldn\u2019t take native people in their hospitals. They\u2019d just send them home,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>But a doctor began lobbying the Province to use Army hospitals that had been set up during the Second World War to treat Indigenous people, Bevan said. One such Army hospital was in Terrace. There, Bevan met people from Telegraph Creek to Haida Gwaii to Lake Babine.</p>\n<p>Those connections, and many others he made along the way, propelled him toward the national stage, Bevan said.</p>\n<p>In retrospect, Bevan said, there is at least one key point he learned in all his work and travels: Indigenous people do not want to be assimilated.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe most important thing to everybody, all across the country, is to stay who they are,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Haida, they don\u2019t want to be anything but Haida. The Nisga\u2019a, they don\u2019t want to be anything but Nisga\u2019a.\u201d</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",

There\u2019s a large wood bin in his driveway, where folks are welcome to drop recycling day or night \u2014 and if you have a lot of recycling, he\u2019ll even come pick it up. He\u2019s also been involved in political activism, and music, for decades.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was taught very early that you help where you can, and so that meant a lot of volunteer work,\u201d he told <em>The</em> <em>Terrace Standard. </em>\u201cIf you have the skills and the abilities, you do what you can for people that don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>He and his wife first got involved with the animal rescue group a few years ago when they fostered a corgi. One thing lead to another, and the pair ended up fostering about 40 more dogs over a couple of years.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a full acre, fenced in,\u201d he said, gesturing from his patio toward the lush green back yard, surrounded by trees and alive with chirping birds. \u201cMy wife\u2019s sister calls this doggy heaven.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now, they have two dogs, which English refers to as \u201cfailed fosters.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFailed is not a bad word, in this case, it just means when you were fostering it, you didn\u2019t want to let it go when the time came,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>The fostering then lead to the recycling collection. He said he spends an average of four hours a day just sorting the recycling, which keeps his mind comfortably occupied.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s mind-numbing, you don\u2019t have to think very hard. Although, please don\u2019t talk to me when I\u2019m sorting because I lose count and have to start all over again,\u201d he said with a chuckle.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>He also collected bottles and cardboard boxes when he was growing up on the Southside decades ago.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it was three cents a piece, for a cardboard box, because most of the people around here needed boxes to carry groceries in,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>English arrived in Terrace with his mother in 1952, when he was about six years old. His father, who grew up in Saskatchewan, first came to Terrace during the Second World War for training and fell in love with the area. After the war, English\u2019s father returned to work as a logger, and the rest of the family followed.</p>\n<p>As a boy, English roamed the woods on the Southside with his friends.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I was around 10, my dad got tired of me losing his hammer,\u201d he said. \u201cFor my birthday he bought me a hammer of my own and a 50 lb. box of nails, and so we built tree forts, and we built bridges and all sorts of things like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>He is a longtime member of the Terrace Pipes and Drums band, which promotes Scottish culture.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been teaching kids to play drums in the pipe band, Terrace Pipes and Drums, for over 40 years now, all the way along,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of COVID we\u2019re not practicing any more, and I really miss that. We won\u2019t be able to march down the middle of the street for a while, because all the gatherings have been cancelled.\u201d</p>\n<p>He drummed for a rock band in his teens and he first became involved with Terrace Pipes and Drums when his brother invited him to a Robbie Burns Day celebration.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeing a drummer, I [would pound] on anything available. As the pipe band went by my table, I was thumping along, and afterwards a friend of mine, who was a piper at the time, still is actually, said \u2018for [Pete\u2019s] sake, English, if you\u2019re going to play anyway, you may as well learn to do it right,\u2019\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cSo, the next day they had a practice, I was there, and I\u2019ve been there ever since.\u201d</p>\n<p>English worked for local sawmills most of his adult life as a heavy equipment operator. He became a shop steward for the local union and, eventually, the union president. Through his union work he became involved with left-wing politics, identifying as a socialist.</p>\n<p>\u201cDuring the downturn in the \u201980s we [the union,] along with the local labour council, had a food bank \u2026 we had a soup kitchen too. We didn\u2019t just feed people, we also taught them left-wing politics,\u201d he said. \u201cThe town was depressed. Very depressed. So that\u2019s why we got the idea to start the soup kitchen to start with and the education portion was just kind of a sideline.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was surprised at just how many people that came for a bowl of soup actually stuck around and learned something. Some of them I still see on a regular basis, and that was, of course, 40 years ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>For many years, English put up all the election signs for the NDP in the area. A photo from 2011 in <em>The Terrace Standard</em> shows English meeting with John Horgan, who was in Terrace campaigning for the B.C. NDP leadership race that year. Horgan lost that race to Adrian Dix, but has since become the party leader and B.C.\u2019s premier.</p>\n<p>English said he\u2019s not impressed with Horgan\u2019s performance thus far.</p>\n<p>\u201cHorgan is not a friend of mine. I don\u2019t like his environmental policies, especially Site C and the fact that he really thinks LNG is a great thing,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>English is still politically involved today. He is vice-chair of the Terrace chapter of the Council of Canadians, a non-partisan group that encourages citizens to vote and, between elections, does education work around environmental issues.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe do want to protect this country. Take a look at it,\u201d he said, gesturing once more toward the lush back yard and the Southside woods he roamed as a boy. \u201cThe last thing in the world we need is pipelines all over the place and LNG plants all over the place.\u201d</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",

The pilot was not able to predict when the wind gusts would die down or what cloud heights would be,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>The matter was discussed at a Terrace city council meeting July 8 attended by mayor Carol Leclerc and some members of council as well as Carman Hendry, manager of the Northwest Regional Airport. A NAV CANADA representative, a BCEHS representative, other Terrace councillors, two councillors from Kitimat and Taylor Bachrach, MP for Skeena\u2014Bulkley Valley, attended via a conference call.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Heather McGonigal, assistant vice president of stakeholder and commercial relations at NAV CANADA, a federal agency, said that suspending the night shift did not result in cost savings for NAV CANADA.</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of our staff are laid off. What we did is we took the people that generally would be at midnight hours where traffic was minimal, and we put them on reserve,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were at home, so that if by chance someone in the daytime hours, which are historically busier, if they became ill or they had an absence, that person that used to be on midnight [shift] could slide into that schedule.\u201d</p>\n<p>NAV CANADA had to apply to Transport Canada for approval to temporarily suspend services, McGonigal said. The service suspension in Terrace began May 13 and can last up to 120 days.</p>\n<p>McGonigal said Terrace was one of 16 airports across the country to face NAV CANADA service reductions.</p>\n<p>Mayor Carol Leclerc asked McGonigal why the the Terrace airport was selected when it serves as a hub for the vast Northwest with the closest major airport being six hours away in Prince George. Leclerc also questioned why the Terrace airport was selected for NAV CANADA\u2019s pandemic precaution measures when there is a relatively low rate of COVID-19 cases in the Northwest.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we have a gap of air service of almost six hours now, that does not help any of us,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we\u2019ve got four people who have been impacted, those lives are important to each and every one of us here.\u201d</p>\n<p>McGonigal said NAV CANADA is looking to resume full service and that may happen sooner in provinces with low infection rates.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are trying to do this systematically and we will definitely be lifting these temporary service measures earlier in some provinces,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Others in the meeting voiced similar sentiments to Leclerc\u2019s. Councillor James Cordeiro said he didn\u2019t believe NAV CANADA\u2019s rationale for reducing flight service in Terrace and Bachrach encouraged McGonigal to explore resuming the service.</p>\n<p>Councillor Sean Bujtas was extremely displeased that Terrace was selected as a location for reduced flight service.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just love hearing that lives in rural communities don\u2019t matter as much as lives in urban communities,\u201d Bujtas said sarcastically. \u201cWe have children, we have parents in these communities and it just seems that people from the larger centres make these decisions with no care.\u201d</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",

    "content_html": "<p>At a time when many folks are stressed about the economy and the pandemic, 12-year-old Angelo Raposo is thriving.</p>\n<p>The enterprising youngster from Thornhill started a yard work business shortly after his school year at Veritas Catholic School ended prematurely due to the pandemic. Raposo told <em>The Terrace Standard </em>he prefers not attending school, even though he still has to do schoolwork from home, because it leaves more flexibility to pursue his true priorities.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe get to spend more time as a family,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I get to do more stuff outdoors, dirtbike and stuff like that. And mow.\u201d</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>He started his business with an old lawn mower he found free on the side of the road. A neighbour was giving the mower away and it was in rough shape, but Raposo fixed it up with his dad.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt needed a change of oil, we took it apart, it needed some new gas, because the gas was really old, and it needed the air filter cleaned, and the carburator cleaned, that was pretty bad,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s running perfect.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mechanics is a passion for Raposo, who learned shop work mainly from his dad.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy dad has been teaching me stuff in the workshop for years \u2026 like how to fix, my dirtbike, I work on that,\u201d he said. \u201cI just enjoy the process of having something that doesn\u2019t run, or is in bad shape, and then working and putting time into it and then having it perfect.\u201d</p>\n<p>Armed with the refurbished mower and a weed-whacker his family owned, Raposo set to work on yards in his neighbourhood, nestled at the foot of Copper Mountain. He charges about $30 to $50, depending on the size of the lawn and whether other tasks need to be done.</p>\n<p>He said he finds the work satisfying.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cI like seeing a lawn go from all messy and long to nice and groomed,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>One neighbour, Claudette Sandecki, was very impressed with Raposo\u2019s work. She said she is a senior and greatly appreciates Raposo\u2019s help keeping her yard tidy.</p>\n<p>\u201c[He] is polite, personable, and a hard worker eager to follow instructions and please,\u201d she wrote in an email to <em>The Terrace Standard</em>. \u201cHe wears a neon safety vest, safety glasses, sturdy shoes, an apron for sawing, and closes down his weed whacker if anyone approaches.\u201d</p>\n<p>Raposo figures he\u2019s earned around $400 so far, which he invested back into the lawncare business. He purchased a small trailer with the help of his mom, Lana Kilgren, so he can load up his equipment and catch a ride from Kilgren to service yards far beyond his Thornhill neigbourhood. Raposo said he hopes to find clients in Terrace proper, though that hasn\u2019t happened yet.</p>\n<p>The trailer is outfitted with an aluminum cross bed toolbox that Raposo and Kilgren found at ABC Recycling. Raposo cleaned it up, but it needed some welding work, so the pair dropped the toolbox off at Western Pacific Metalworks. The shop fixed up Raposo\u2019s toolbox free of charge. (Raposo said he does a lot of welding himself but he does not have an aluminum welder.)</p>\n<p>That\u2019s not the only help the community has given to Raposo\u2019s business. Kilgren said she went to Staples to have small signs printed to display on the side of a wagon Raposo uses to move equipment, and when she went to collect the print job, someone had anonymously paid the bill.</p>\n<p>Raposo said his next financial goal is to purchase a new lawnmower, one that can propel itself forward, which would allow him to service bigger lawns. After that, he plans to buy himself a new dirtbike.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s lived his whole life in Thornhill, where he rides his dirtbike every chance he gets \u2014 sometimes with his dad, sometimes with buddies from the neighbourhood.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust a couple days ago I was riding up to my dad\u2019s with my friend and I\u2019m pretty sure I saw a black bear maybe 10 m away,\u201d he said nonchalantly. \u201cIt was just like grazing, didn\u2019t really bother us.\u201d</p>\n<p>When asked what he wants to be when he grows up, Raposo answered immediately.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to be a millwright,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I want to go get another year welding.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow come you\u2019re thinking ahead?\u201d asked his mom with a smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you told me to?\u201d Raposo replied.</p>\n<p>Kilgren said she was not surprised when Raposo embraced the lawncare business.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe tends to be pretty ambitious, and he\u2019s always trying to think of ways to achieve his goals, so I worked with him to get this all together,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>The pair have spent a lot of quality time together since the pandemic began. They\u2019ve been working on their own yard, which has benefitted from Raposo\u2019s lawncare expertise. They planted potatoes and built a rock garden with succulents. Kilgren said they have also been working together on refurbishing a travel trailer, a project they didn\u2019t have time for prior to the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Raposo said he isn\u2019t overly concerned about current world events.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t really watch a lot of the media,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happy that school\u2019s out at least.\u201d</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",

    "content_html": "<p>Some Coastal GasLink pipeline workers could be housed at hotels in Terrace as work ramps up this summer and the workforce expands by hundreds.</p>\n<p>Representatives of the project developer met with Terrace city council June 19 to provide an update on the company\u2019s plans heading into the summer construction season. During spring, construction efforts on the leg of pipeline close to Kitimat were focused on clearing the pipeline\u2019s path \u2014 work that can largely be performed by local workers, said Kiel Giddens, public affairs manager with TC Energy, which is overseeing the pipeline project.</p>\n<p>The pipeline route stretches from northeastern gasfields to the LNG Canada facility, also under construction, at Kitimat.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>But with the summer construction season approaching, contractors are preparing to begin main line construction and will need significantly more workers. It\u2019s expected that the first pipe in ground will be on the Kitimat leg of the pipeline, sometime mid-July, said Jessica Stephens, public affairs advisor for TC Energy, in the update to council. Stephens also said construction work will begin soon on a meter station near Kitimat, which will be the last such station on the pipeline and will measure the gas that will go to the LNG Canada facility.</p>\n<p>Stephens said there are currently 191 Coastal GasLink workers at Sitka Lodge, a workforce accommodation site in Kitimat, but that number is expected to climb to 600 by the end of July and to peak at 650 by November. There are also 36 workers staying at Hunter Creek Lodge northeast of Kitimat, and occupancy there is expected to peak at 76 workers.</p>\n<p>Giddens told council that the project developer tries to avoid housing workers outside workforce accommodations because they don\u2019t want to disrupt local rental markets, but sometimes it might be necessary to do so in order to maintain pandemic health guidance distancing in the workforce accommodation facility. Terrace hotels could be a good alternative option, Giddens said.</p>\n<p>\u201cLocal hotels, if that is something that still can be considered, I think there is still room for that. There is going to be times during construction when those still may be required,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Councillor Sean Bujtas said local hotels have been hit hard by a decrease in tourism due to the pandemic, and he would support hotels being used by Coastal GasLink.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d personally support the use of hotels this year, because obviously the tourism industry has been impacted, so if there\u2019s a need to use our hotels to maintain that social distancing, I would fully support that,\u201d he said.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Councillor Brian Downie and Mayor Carol Leclerc also voiced support for the use of hotels.</p>\n<p>Local workers are always a priority, Giddens told council, but this phase of the project will require workers coming from other provinces and possibly even some international workers. He noted that most of the international workers for the project have been living locally for over a year.</p>\n<p>Ben Rayner, manager of safety programs on the project, said anyone traveling from an international location would be required to self-quarantine for 14 days, per federal guidelines, and would do so in large centres such as Vancouver or Calgary because those areas have the most robust healthcare systems. He also said workers coming from other provinces are strongly encouraged to drive instead of fly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe protocols are really just around journey management, using hotels safely, using vehicles to come in,\u201d he told council. \u201cAs well, prior to that journey we also make sure that any of those workers are not showing any signs of symptoms, there\u2019s a pre-questionnaire that they need to fill out and observe before they come into the area, and there is a short interview as well with a supervisor, just to ensure that person is ready for that journey, and they\u2019re in good healthy shape.\u201d</p>\n<p>Coastal GasLink representatives also asked council if workers would be welcome at businesses in the community if pandemic safety guidelines were to further relax in B.C.</p>\n<p>Downie said workers would be welcome in Terrace if B.C. were to reach phase 3 of its gradual reopening plan.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe question is probably more education of the communities by the project, by Coastal GasLink, of what kind of measures you put in place, what happens where there is a person with COVID-19,\u201d he said. \u201cI think any community would want to know all the conditions these workers are facing so they understand the extent of the risk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Giddens said Coastal GasLink has been communicating its project COVID-19 safety measures. Literature on the Coastal GasLink website states that COVID-19 safety priorities for workers include limiting interaction with communities, following all government guidelines, and access to personal protective equipment.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",

    "content_html": "<p>A longstanding geothermal energy project near Lakelse Lake has cleared a major exploration milestone and is now looking for more government funding.</p>\n<p>Kitselas Geothermal Inc., which is run in partnership between Kitselas Development Corporation and Calgary-based Borealis GeoPower, first began pre-feasibility studies of geothermal hotspots near Lakelse Lake back in 2014. This involved initial surveying for subsurface water and heat. Then in 2018 the project entered its exploration phase, which involved drilling wells to further determine the location of hot subsurface water.</p>\n<p>The exploration drilling was a success, representatives from Kitselas Geothermal Inc. told Terrace city council June 8. The representatives appeared before council to request a letter of support to be used while campaigning for federal and provincial funding.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Tim Thompson, chairman of Borealis GeoPower, said four exporation wells were drilled on the west side of Lakelse Lake, across the lake from the Mount Layton Hot Springs. Three of the exploration wells were successful.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe broadly confirmed that we\u2019re fairly correct about the geothermal resource,\u201d he told council. \u201cWe worked about 3800 hours and we basically didn\u2019t cause any problems. No safety incidents, traffic, no environmental. We didn\u2019t hit anything archaeological or cultural interest.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thompson explained that the Terrace area is atop a region of the Earth\u2019s crust that is being pulled apart which creates fratures in the crust and allows magma to rise closer than normal to the surface, heating subsurface water.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a rose, in terms of its structure. A whole set of interleaving planar fractures, each one like one of the petals of a rose. We\u2019re trying to drill around and find those petals,\u201d he said. \u201cWe try to find them shallow. So the whole idea is if you have the surface and a fracture, you don\u2019t want to spend a whole lot of money drilling deep here and miss it, but you can drill really short over here and confirm where it is and its angle \u2026 Now you know where your target is.\u201d</p>\n<p>The drilling results suggested there is water at least 150 degrees celsius \u2014 a susbstantial amount of heat energy. Kiteseas Geothermal Inc.\u2019s next set of wells will likely be production wells which can harness that heat energy for a variety of uses, Thompson said.</p>\n<p>One possible use would be to pipe that hot subsurface water out to the Skeena Industrial Development Park, convert the heat energy to other forms (such as electrical energy) for use by planned industrial projects there, then pipe the cooled water back underground. The closest exploration well is about 5.5 km from the industrial park.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an art to this, but if you put the water back in the right place, it will re-heat,\u201d Thompson said.</p>\n<p>Top Speed Energy\u2019s proposed Skeena LNG project is one such development at the industrial park which could benefit from the proposed geothermal infrastructure. The Skeena LNG project would take natural gas from a PNG pipeline, supercool the gas to make it inert for transport, then store the supercooled gas in special containers that could be trucked to the port in Prince Rupert for export to Asia.</p>\n<p>Currently the Skeena LNG project, which is not yet under construction, is set to cool its natural gas using hyrdoelectric power from a BC Hydro transmission line. But Kitselas Geothermal Inc. and Top Speed Energy have had preliminary discussions about using geothermal energy, instead of hydroelectric energy, to cool the natural gas, according to Top Speed Energy CEO Clark Roberts.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had discussions with them about the opportunity of them providing pre-chilling services, where they take the gas and cool it down for us,\u201d he told <em>The Terrace Standard</em>. \u201cFor us, it is a choice between hydro electricity and geothermal electricity, so both choices are clean choices, but what [Kitselas Geothermal Inc. is] saying is that they can save us money.\u201d</p>\n<p>Roberts said the feasibility of the proposal has yet to be determined and it\u2019s not clear if the geothermal infrastructure will be ready by the time construction starts on the Skeena LNG project, which is set to begin in fall of 2021, provided the project passes government review.</p>\n<p>At the June 8 council meeeting, Mayor Carol Leclerc said council has long been interested in geothermal power.

For example, one such guideline on the list states that the main floor of a house could have an estimated value of $80 per square foot. Another guideline states attached garages could have an estimated value of $30 per square foot.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Once the estimated value is determined, the City charges a building fee of $8 per $1,000 of estimated value, another $1 per $1,000 of estimated value for building plan review, plus other applicable charges such as sewer connection fees.</p>\n<p>Lyle Salekin, owner of CDG Enterprises, one of the larger property developers in Terrace who has built numerous houses in recent years, told <em>The Terrace Standard</em> that he and City building officials disagree on how to interpret that bylaw when estimating project value.</p>\n<p>Salekin said he believes the interpretable part of the guidelines is the bit that specifies to which part of the building a certain estimate value should apply.

    "content_html": "<p>The annual King of the Mountain foot race in Terrace will look different this year because of the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Normally all contestants run together on the same day around Flathead Loop trail, but this year, the 43rd anniversary of the race, the competition will be virtual. Contestants can run the route any time between July 11 and August 11, tracking their position and time using a GPS app. This year the race will be about 6.5 km long with about 330 m of elevation change.</p>\n<p>Joe Pelletier, president of race organizer Skeena Valley Runners, said the pandemic situation is so fluid that organizers decided to play it safe and not plan a traditional race this year.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seeing all the big name events, like the Boston Marathon, they\u2019re going virtual, so we said let\u2019s just go virtual too,\u201d he told <em>The Terrace Standard.</em></p>\n<p>He said a physical race would have been limited to 50 people and runners would have to stagger their starts to maintain 6 ft. of distancing, per provincial guidelines.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd no after party, which is a big part of these events,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Pelletier said runners will pay a fee to enter the race and 100 per cent of the proceeds will be donated to Terrace Search and Rescue, which is pushing to complete its new headquarters building on Greig Ave. this year.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the big reasons we\u2019re pushing through rather than cancelling is, historically, King of the Mountain is a fundraiser for Terrace Search and Rescue and this year, more than many years, they need financial help.\u201d</p>\n<p>Organizers had to alter the route slightly this year, Pelletier said. Normally, runners start at the Sportsplex arena and run up to Flathead Loop. But with the virtual format going on for a month, organizers can\u2019t manage traffic and other safety conditions around the arena, so runners are asked to start the race directly on the trail. This shaves roughly 2 kilometres from the race, which means the recorded times will be significantly shorter than previous years.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be quite a bit quicker than previous times,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to make that adjustment on the trophy and make that note in the historical archive of the race.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pelletier said he hopes the virtual format will reduce some pressure and make the race accessible to folks who are normally intimidated by the mountain challenge.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a mountain and it kind of scares some people off,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, because it\u2019s not an event, and they can just do it on their own and still participate, we\u2019re hoping to get a lot of walkers out, maybe the casual runners, rather than just some of the hardcore mountain runners.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anyone wishing to register or donate can do so at www.skeenarunners.com</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",

But the atmosphere in B.C. has relaxed since then, with businesses and organizations slowly reopening.</p>\n<p>Now the farmers\u2019 market is looking to follow that trend because the online market has limitations and farmers really need to sell their produce, said Norman Frank, president of the market\u2019s board of directors.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get our farmers\u2019 produce to the public, and the online thing just really doesn\u2019t work too well,\u201d he said, adding that co-ordinating pickup or delivery of purchased food was difficult with the online format. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get our farmers\u2019 produce to the public, and the online thing just really doesn\u2019t work too well.\u201d</p>\n<p>The plan is to reopen the market in phases, with phase one consisting only of agricultural vendors.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe reason for that is we just don\u2019t know what kind of a response we\u2019re going to get from the community, and we\u2019re concerned, and the City is concerned, about crowd control,\u201d Frank said.</p>\n<p>Entry and exit from the market will be tightly controlled, with tables set up at the entrance to the market with hand sanitizer and towels. Signs will be in place reminding people to keep their distance from one another and reminding people not to loiter.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt always has been a social event for everyone, but this year is different, we can\u2019t have people inside that area that is secured, we can\u2019t have them waiting inside there for half an hour talking with friends and that kind of stuff,\u201d Frank said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a situation where you go in, buy what you have to \u2026 and leave, and let the next person come in.\u201d</p>\n<p>If phase one goes well, the market will proceed to phase two which will include vendors selling things like preserves, baked goods, and coffee. Frank said he hopes phase two will be only one week after phase one. However, craft vendors will not be able to participate in the market until B.C. lifts the two-metre physical distancing recommendation, as there is limited space within the market.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Frank said he was to meet Northern Health officials at the market site so they could ensure the market will be safe and follow health guidelines.</p>\n<p>The market also had to send a COVID-19 safety plan to the City of Terrace, which is currently under review. Carmen Didier, director of leisure services for the City, told council at a June 2 meeting that her department approved the market reopening in principle, with confidence that the market\u2019s safety plan would be in order. </p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",

She recommended the Sportsplex and the Terrace and District Aquatic Centre remain closed until at least September.</p>\n<p>The recommendations are essentially based on the Province\u2019s phased reopening plan, Didier said, and council should amend the plans if the pandemic changes course.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cIt all depends on where we are in this pandemic, if we stay in phase 2, or we move into phase 3, and how council would like that to correlate with the levels of opening up the facilities,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Didier said her department is planning to disinfect playground equipment once per day in high-touch areas. The department is also prepared to post signs with safety guidelines including a 2 metres physical distancing and a suggestion that hands be disinfected before and after using the equipment. However, these are just guidelines, Didier said, and the City is not required to enforce them.</p>\n<p>\u201c[There] is not an expectation that children have to stay away from one another on the playgrounds, but we are putting it on our posters,\u201d she said, noting that anyone using the equipment would be responsible for bringing their own hand sanitizer.</p>\n<p>Councillor James Cordeiro asked why playgrounds are deemed ready to open, while the Sportsplex is not.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just sort of curious why a playground would be deemed to be less risk than, say, the Sportsplex, given that the playground has no staff supervision,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Didier said her playground recommendations were based on information from the BC Recreation and Parks Association (BCRPA,) which indicated playgrounds are relatively safe.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cThere is still going to be an element of risk, but all the science and what we\u2019ve been told is that the transmission on a playground from kids playing on a playground is minimal compared to other aspects of recreation,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Tyler Clarke, program supervisor with the City\u2019s leisure services department, told council that youth day camps can still run this summer, but significantly modified for safety during the pandemic.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s likely the camps will be for kids 6 \u2013 12 years old. Parents will be able to sign a child up for one week at a time, consisting of either two morning sessions or two afternoon sessions. For example, Monday morning and Wednesday morning. Each session will be limited to 15 kids and will only run for three hours, which is shorter than previous years.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe shorter days do mean less touch points and more kids can participate safely,\u201d Clarke told council. \u201cOne of the key ideas behind going with just the three-hour session is, we don\u2019t have to do the lunch breaks or the snack breaks, so simply bringing a water bottle for these sessions will work.\u201d</p>\n<p>Parents will have to sign specific COVID-19 waivers in order for their children to participate, Clarke said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe BCRPA recommends with the waivers, that is enough in place that we do not need to do extra care for the physical distancing. So, will they be playing tag? That is an option,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not required to actively enforce physical distancing within these camps because our numbers are low.\u201d</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",

However, B.C.\u2019s environment minister has the power to order an environmental assessment of any proposal if a member of the public writes to request one and the minister deems a review to be in the public interest.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s imperative the Skeena LNG project avoid the Environmental Assessment Office, Ross told council.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have no idea where that\u2019s going to go if it ends up at that place. You have no idea how long it\u2019s going to take, how long it\u2019s going to cost,\u201d he said. \u201cThe permitting has to stay within the B.C. Oil and Gas Commission, and keep it at that. That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about in terms of red tape.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anne Hill, co-chair of environmental advocacy group North West Watch, said her organization will be writing the environment minister to request an environmental assessment of the Skeena LNG project. She said North West Watch has raised several safety concerns about the project and the only answers they\u2019ve received have come from Top Speed Energy.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just rely on the proponent to answer questions about the safety of their own project,\u201d she said, adding that North West Watch does not have faith in the B.C. Oil and Gas Commission\u2019s review process. \u201cThe B.C. Oil and Gas Commission are not in the business of rejecting projects. It is basically a rubber stamp.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ross also told council at the May 27 meeting that he is concerned about regulatory delays due to the pandemic.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cThe only question right now is the timing, and the efficiency in terms of the responses that Top Speed is going to get from the regulator, which is the Oil and Gas Commission. This COVID-19 has slowed down everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to know, number one, when do we get back on track? Any kind of news is good news in terms of what the Oil and Gas Commission will do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clark Roberts, CEO of Top Speed Energy, told the <em>The Terrace Standard</em> that the application process to the oil and gas commission is still moving along.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure COVID-19 has slowed things down a bit, but [the B.C. Oil and Gas Commission] haven\u2019t stopped the project, and we\u2019re hopeful that we will obtain our facility permit in due course,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Council opted to invite a representative of the B.C. Oil and Gas Commission to appear before council to provide more information.</p>\n<p>Council had previously passed a motion Dec. 9, 2019 declaring support for the Skeena LNG project, provided the proposal passes review by the B.C. Oil and Gas Commission. Councillor Jessica McCallum-Miller opposed the motion, according to minutes from the meeting. The motion was put forward by councillor James Cordeiro following a presentation Hill made to council about North West Watch\u2019s concerns regarding Skeena LNG.</p>\n<p>Hill told <em>The Terrace Standard</em> that she was displeased with council\u2019s response to her presentation.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey appear to be pushing the project and they are very resistant to asking too many questions. That was my feeling,\u201d she said.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",

The lighter, the better,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Jay said egg drops were a regular fixture at district science fairs years ago, but those science fairs no longer take place, so she decided to bring the egg drop to Cassie Hall Elementary school.</p>\n<p>Shore and Jay both said they assumed the egg drop wouldn\u2019t happen this year because of physical distancing, but Peggy Gilliard, a Thornhill volunteer firefighter, saw the egg drop come up in her calender and she suggested pushing forward with the event.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the firefighting thing, [we] always say \u2018adapt and overcome,\u2019\u201d Gilliard said.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",

RCMP set up a road block on Hwy 16 near the Dudley Little Bridge, but the suspect pickup truck rammed through the road block, nearly injuring two officers. That is about the time the driver of the Wonder Bread truck parked his vehicle across the highway, stopping the suspect pickup truck.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>After several months in custody, Shanoss was initially granted bail March 2o, under the condition that he reside at a drug rehabilitation facility near Kamloops. He is accused of breaching bail conditions by failing to return to the rehab facility after a trip to hospital March 21, stealing a pickup truck, and remaining at large for weeks until he was arrested in Smithers May 6.</p>\n<p>Crown counsel laid out these accusations as part of a detailed list of Shanoss\u2019 alleged criminal activity over the last six months which was presented at Shanoss\u2019 most recent bail hearing, on May 12, according to a judgement document from that hearing. Shanoss is also accused of failing to report to a probation officer in New Hazelton on Nov. 7, just before the chase in Terrace.</p>\n<p>The presiding judge, M. J. Brecknell, wrote in the judgement that the court must factor those allegations into its final decision for the bail hearing. He noted the bail hearing was a reverse-onus situation, meaning it was Shanoss\u2019 responsibility to prove he should be released on bail.</p>\n<p>Shanoss\u2019 attorney presented a bail plan arguing Shanoss should be released on bail to a house arrest situation, with conditions mandating he attend drug treatment and agree to weekly drug testing. According to the judgement document, Shanoss said at the hearing he is too old to continue a criminal lifestyle and he wants to get off drugs. He also said he is afraid to live in a correctional facility because of the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Brecknell called the bail plan unsatisfactory and denied bail, noting Shanoss\u2019 alleged history of violating bail conditions.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe likelihood of his further offending and his possible endangerment of the public and RCMP members cannot be reduced to an acceptable level by any bail conditions that might be crafted,\u201d the judge wrote.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>The judge acknowledged correctional facilities are vulnerable to COVID-19 outbreaks, which he factored into the decision, noting Shanoss is not extraordinarily vulnerable to the pandemic.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is no evidence Mr. Shanoss has any related health vulnerabilities,\u201d Brecknell wrote. \u201cThe factors suggesting his detention are manifold and the balancing of them with the Covid-19 situation still requires his detention on these matters.\u201d</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",

It doesn\u2019t answer the question of who, if anyone, spit in the customer\u2019s pizza, or why it might have happened.</p>\n<p>Both the customer and Domino\u2019s Pizza Terrace indicated that a sample of the alleged spit was collected for DNA testing.</p>\n<p>Screenshots of comments on the customer\u2019s original post show her stating that a sample of spit was collected and sent to her local health office for testing.</p>\n<p>A statement released by Domino\u2019s Pizza Terrace also referenced DNA testing.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>\u201cWe are eagerly working with Kitsumkalum Health Centre to process DNA tests and review our camera footage proving our innocence,\u201d said the statement, which called the allegations \u201c100% false.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kitsumkalum Health can\u2019t comment on the incident as the matter is under investigation by authorities, said its director, Charlene Webb.</p>\n<p>Northern Health is not involved in any DNA testing, Palmer said, nor would they be in any incidents such as this one.</p>\n<p><em>The Terrace Standard </em>spoke with the customer\u2019s family and Domino\u2019s Pizza Terrace, both of whom said they won\u2019t comment before hearing results of an investigation into the matter.</p>\n<p>The customer\u2019s mother-in-law said the experience was traumatic for the customer and said the family won\u2019t comment further until investigations are concluded.</p>\n<p>A representative of Domino\u2019s Pizza Terrace, reached through their Facebook page, did not share their name and said they can\u2019t comment further as the investigation is ongoing.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll I can tell you is that we\u2019re working with the RCMP, Kitsumkalum Health and Northern Health,\u201d the representative wrote.</p>\n<p>RCMP won\u2019t comment due to privacy concerns, said Terrace RCMP spokesperson Cst.

Council had little to say on the matter, opting to simply carry forward priorities set last year, which include increased visible RCMP presence in the downtown core, more traffic enforcement, working more closely with community agencies on matters of addiction and domestic violence, and respectful workplace training for RCMP members. </p>\n<p>But council did have several general questions for the Inspector.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>Mayor Carol Leclerc asked if the detachment\u2019s workload was affected by the pandemic. Lucash said the detachment\u2019s workload was unusually light in mid-March, around the time COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic, but the number of files being handled now is just two per cent lower than this time last year.</p>\n<p>\u201cMid-March was down substantially, the amount of volume there, which in a way was a blessing because it gave a lot of the [Terrace RCMP] members an opportunity to catch up on their paperwork,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>And, he added, the number of files forwarded to crown prosecutors, in the expectation of charges being laid, is up six per cent compared to this time last year.</p>\n<p>Lucash said the detachment received a number of calls that were COVID-19 \u201ctattle-taling,\u201d where people were, for example, phoning to report their neighbours for not maintaining social distancing.</p>\n<p>Councillor Brian Downie asked for an update on enforcement of drug trafficking. Lucash said the detachment\u2019s investigative unit spent much of last year working on top-priority investigations including a homicide.</p>\n<p>When they finished the majority of the work on those files, the investigative unit then had time to focus on a drug trafficking investigation which lead to a serious drug bust and arrests at a house on Scott Ave.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>The investigative unit continues to pursue drug trafficking, Lucash said, but they may have to shift their focus if another serious event such as a homicide happens.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey do have several other targets in mind. There are other investigations that are ongoing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut sometimes they do get pushed to the side when other events take place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Councillor James Cordeiro said there is a small group of repeat offenders who shoplift in town, and asked Lucash what is being done to solve that issue.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt does seem to me that it is a small group of prolific offenders that are just constantly popping up and shoplifting and causing other issues,\u201d Cordeiro said. \u201cI\u2019m just curious what the strategy is for dealing with these prolific offenders, because there doesn\u2019t seem to be much that has been effective in dealing with them, or any way of deterring them from re-offending.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lucash said judges are extremely hesitant, during the pandemic, to send convicted offenders to correctional facilities.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo we are getting a lot of prolific individuals, who we are targeting, who are getting successful convictions on, but who are being almost immediately returned to the community,\u201d he said. \u201cI am hoping that will change as the pandemic kind of runs its course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Lucash said, the RCMP keeps a close eye on repeat offenders.</p>\n<p>\u201c[We] know who those individuals are,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not afforded any breaks.\u201d</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",

    "content_html": "<p>The RCMP\u2019s national training academy closed in March due to COVID-19 concerns, causing a ripple effect in the Terrace area.</p>\n<p>The City of Terrace increased police spending in its 2020 budget with the hope of increasing police presence in the region to respond to an increase in crime. But when the pandemic struck, the likelihood of getting more boots on the ground plummeted.</p>\n<p>The Terrace RCMP detachment\u2019s staff levels routinely fluctuate, as officers transfer away or go on leave, said Inspector Jayson Lucash, the officer in charge at the Terrace detachment. Replacement officers usually come straight out of the RCMP\u2019s national training academy in Regina, known as Depot, which closed in March due to COVID-19 concerns, pinching off the main supply line of new officers to Terrace.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>With Depot closed there will be a delay in replacing any departing officers, Lucash said.</p>\n<p>\u201cTerrace, for the most part, especially recently, we\u2019ve gotten primarily recruits. Now, obviously, Depot is closed, I don\u2019t have a time frame of when it\u2019s going to open up, so again, there will be a lag,\u201d he told <em>The Terrace Standard</em>.</p>\n<p>Lucash said the goal is to maintain full ranks, but that isn\u2019t always feasible.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn a perfect world, yeah, I would like to have that member transfer out one day and their replacement start at the same time, and that\u2019s what we strive for, but again \u2026 doesn\u2019t always happen,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Depot remains closed and the RCMP are working with health authorities to determine the best approach for reopening the training facility, according to a spokesperson for the RCMP Depot Division.</p>\n<p>After Depot closed, the City of Terrace reduced its police budget by $120,000, roughly equivalent to the cost of one officer for a year.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;\"></div><p>That could have resulted in a smaller-than-forecast tax hike at a time when many residents were upset the city was increasing spending despite financial pressures brought on by COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, some councillors were so concerned about crime that a motion was passed 4-3, with the mayor breaking a tie, to spend a portion of that money to hire two seasonal bylaw officers to patrol downtown this summer. Councillor James Cordeiro identified dirty needles and violence as issues in the downtown core.</p>\n<p>Heather Avison, chief administrative officer for the City, told <em>The Terrace Standard</em> there has been an increase in crime which is partially attributable to major resource developments nearby.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is definitely a factor in some of the increased criminal activity that we\u2019re seeing in the region, and it\u2019s actually pretty well-researched that large-scale economic development projects will attract that type of thing,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Data from Terrace RCMP quarterly reports to the City does seem to indicate an increase in crime in recent years. Terrace RCMP responded to 14,029 files in 2019, a 20 per cent increase over 2017, which saw police respond to 11,629 files.</p>\n<p>Just last year, following lobbying by the City, provincial public safety minister Mike Farnsworth promised to create a four-officer relief team that could fill various vacant posts in the northwest as needed.</p>\n<p>Staff Sergeant Michael Robinson, from the Terrace RCMP detachment, said the four-officer relief team had been created, but he was not certain if those four positions had been filled yet.</p>\n<p>Representatives from North District RCMP in Prince George, the admininstrative headquarters in the north for the police force, did not respond to questions about the relief team by press deadline.</p>\n<hr width=\"75%\"/>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jake.wray@terracestandard.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br/> jake.wray@terracestandard.com</a><br/><strong>Like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terracestandard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> </strong></p>",

The referendum required over 50 per cent of PC Alberta votes and 75 per cent of Wildrose Party votes in order to pass. 95 per cent of the ballots from each party were cast in favour of unity.</p>\n<p>The new conglomerate party, called the United Conservative Party (UCP), is now the official opposition in Alberta\u2019s legislature. The UCP selected Nathan Cooper, who came into the UCP as a Wildrose Party MLA, to serve as its interim leader until the actual leadership vote on Oct. 28.</p>\n<p>Jim Lightbody, a political scientist at the University of Alberta, said there is still plenty of work to be done in merging the two parties.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of mechanical stuff. Integrating constitutions, figuring out how to deal with financial rules,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got two quite autonomous organizations here. Even though they\u2019ve voted to unite, each thinks they\u2019re better than the other. There\u2019s going to be a lot of personalities that have to be dealt with, so it\u2019s a long path to get to the unified party.\u201d</p>\n<p>The core principles of the UCP won\u2019t be finalized until a leader is elected in October, according to Lightbody. He said PC Alberta leader Jason Kenney and Wildrose Party leader Brian Jean are likely to be the frontrunners in that leadership race.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause of their experience being leaders and because of the fact that they will have had close working relations with many of the people who will form the party executive and the two caucuses in the legislature, whether that will present an insurmountable barrier, I think it will, to someone from outside coming in, remains to be seen,\u201d Lightbody said. \u201cThere\u2019s no one in the legislature who has sufficient standing to be taken seriously (as a leadership candidate) in comparison to Kenney and Jean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gord Molnar, a Wildrose Party member (and now UCP member) from Stony Plain, said he will keep an open mind throughout the leadership race.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will be open moving forward, with how each of the candidates present themselves, because I don\u2019t know all the candidates very well, but I do know Brian Jean. If I had to vote today, I\u2019d vote for Brian Jean,\u201d Molnar said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really (strike) me as being one of the old boys\u2019 club. He seems to be a little bit of, I guess, a revolutionary. He\u2019s got some very strong credentials. He\u2019s a lawyer by trade, but he\u2019s also a trapper, so when you look at blue-collar/white-collar, he fits the mould of probably (the majority) of the populace.\u201d</p>\n<p>Molnar said he voted in favour of unification. His biggest concern moving forward, he said, is that core Wildrose Party values could get put aside in the merger.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only fear that I have is maybe losing some of those grassroots principles, where everyone has a voice. Like, even the MLAs I think within the Wildrose, they\u2019re allowed a free vote. They\u2019re allowed to vote on conscience. They don\u2019t necessarily have to toe the party line,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are things that are really held strong in my view, is the fact that you can be free in the Wildrose. You can speak what you want to speak and you can do what you want to do without recourse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Article originally appeared in <a href=\"http://www.sprucegroveexaminer.com/2017/07/27/conservative-parties-merge-after-referendum\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Spruce Grove Examiner</a></p>\n </div>",

Homeowners beyond the range have complained of stray bullets. \u2013 Photo by Jake Wray Reporter/Examiner</figcaption></figure>\n<p>July 20, 2017</p>\n<p>By Jake Wray</p>\n<p>The Spruce Grove Gun Club (SGGC) has begun a defamation lawsuit, by filing a statement of claim, against Parkland County Mayor Rod Shaigec.</p>\n<p>The statement of claim, which was filed on July 13 at the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Edmonton, is centred on comments Shaigec allegedly made about another lawsuit against the SGGC. Darren and Natasha Degeer, who owned a home downrange from the SGGC, sued the gun club in 2014 after finding a bullet lodged in the wall of their house. The Degeers eventually dropped their case against the SGGC and it was never legally established that the bullet lodged in their house came from the SGGC.</p>\n<p>According to Bill Newton, a spokesperson for the SGGC, the new defamation suit is in response to an email the SGGC says that Shaigec sent to a county resident implying that the bullet that hit the Degeers\u2019 house had in fact come from the SGGC.</p>\n<p>\u201c(Shaigec wrote that) the bullet that hit the Degeer\u2019s home was fired from a semi-automatic firearm and that semi-automatic firearms can only be fired on a range like (the SGGC\u2019s range,) legally,\u201d Newton said. \u201cHis comment that semi-automatic firearms can only be used on a range \u2014 that\u2019s completely inaccurate. Guys can hunt deer with semi-automatic rifles, and do, so why (Mayor Shaigec) would say that, I don\u2019t know, but it certainly is, in our mind, defamatory.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shaigec did not respond to interview requests by press deadline.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit was filed just days after Parkland County council took the first steps toward enacting a bylaw amendment that would jeopardize the SGGC. On July 11 council voted 5-2 in favour of the first reading of a Land Use Bylaw amendment that would prohibit outdoor shooting ranges in land zoned as country residential. The property where SGGC has operated since the early seventies is currently zoned as country residential.</p>\n<p>At the Parkland County council meeting on July 11, nearly 20 members of the public made statements to council about the bylaw amendment, including Greg Zederayko, a member of the SGGC who asked Shaigec to \u201crecuse himself\u201d from voting on the amendment.</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe, as do many others, that the mayor has demonstrated a longstanding bias toward the SGGC, (and) has already made up his mind that the council should amend the bylaw as presented,\u201d Zederayko said. \u201cIt\u2019s alleged that in 2013 the mayor told them and other residents that the County would not renew the (SGGC\u2019s) development permit once it expired in June 2014. As we know, the mayor and council are not entitled to input as to whether or not a development permit should be renewed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shaigec responded immediately to Zederayko\u2019s accusations.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will not recuse myself. I have demonstrated in my seven years of public service that I consider the facts from all parties when deliberating any matter that comes before council, and I will do so with this particular issue that\u2019s before council for debate and discussion. I will do so without prejudice,\u201d Shaigec said. \u201cI can state unequivocally, for the record, that I did not make, nor did any council member, make any statement to any member of the public or the (SGGC) that I would direct, or any council member would ensure, that a development permit would not be issued.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shaigec has until Aug. 2 to file a statement of defence, or a demand for notice, in response or he risks automatically losing the lawsuit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://www.sprucegroveexaminer.com/2017/07/20/gun-club-sues-parkland-county-mayor/wcm/4c816862-c6c1-4d5b-0834-58f6ece8da1e\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Spruce Grove Examiner</a></p>\n </div>",

At the same meeting, the LSU also fired its legal counsel, which had recommended Rodenbour, and an elected board member.</p>\n<p>Harsimran Malhi, who was elected in this year\u2019s spring election, said she was fired last week after spending months trying to enact reform in the student union.</p>\n<h4>Staff allegedly threatened board members</h4>\n<p>Malhi said the LSU staff threatened to take legal action if she kept trying to improve transparency and modernize the union.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were threatened a few times,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like we were told \u2018you\u2019ll face grievances because this is not something that is our job.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Officially, she was fired for missing two board meetings. She said she had alerted the GM that she would miss the meetings for personal issues that had come up.</p>\n<p>Malhi said she felt like some staff were unsupportive.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe saw threats were given to us because we were trying to ask for policies because if you don\u2019t know what the policies say, how can you do something?\u201d She added that as a council member, they would be \u201caccused of things again and again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malhi said it was made very clear to her when she was elected, that asking questions was not seen favourably by the staff.</p>\n<p>Malhi said staff also balked when council members discussed hiring legal counsel.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey basically walked out of the meeting,\u201d she told <em>The Voice</em>. \u201cWe wanted everyone to be on board. But the reaction that we got was really unexpected.\u201d</p>\n<h4>Allegations of financial impropriety</h4>\n<p>Emma Leigha Munro, a former LSU member-at-large, said she witnesssed questionable financial decisions, although Malhi claims she never witnessed any evidence of that.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere were definitely things that were questionable,\u201d Munro said Thursday. \u201cSuch as alcoholic beverages at a party, open tabs, board parties, Christmas parties.\u201d</p>\n<p>Munro told <em>The Voice</em> that she was suspicious of LSU spending and her feeling was that staff wielded the real power in the LSU while elected members were treated as pawns.</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel like they ran the whole thing and we were just there because they needed it to look like we were there,\u201d Munro said.</p>\n<p>Another source familiar with the LSU said he was unimpressed with the way things were run and staff often pressured council members to do their bidding.</p>\n<p>The source expressed concern about the number of people pushed out over the last 16 months.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s essentially like putting Langara back into the dark ages,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p><em>The Voice</em> reached out for comment from the LSU, which did not respond.</p>\n<p>Another issue raised was how staff tried to prevent elected board members from connecting with other student societies, including the umbrella Alliance of B.C. Students.</p>\n<p>In an April 2016 email obtained by <em>The Voice</em>, LSU staff member Gurbax Lealh instructed ABCS officials to always contact LSU staff before approaching elected LSU council members.</p>\n<p><em>The Voice</em>, Thursday, attempted to contact the LSU for comment and got no response.</p>\n<p>Langara College officials also declined to comment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Article originally appeared in\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://www.langaravoice.ca/2016/12/02/lsu-accused-of-misconduct/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Langara Voice</a></em></p>\n </div>",
